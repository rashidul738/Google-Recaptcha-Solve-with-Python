"This is a great pub in a sleepy town with not much downtown action. The beer was good, as was the beer cheese soup and bread. Very good prices and great service.",25-Jul-21,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52046-d15562998-r799793581-North_Forty_Beer_Company-Roseburg_Oregon.html
"The location is great and the vibe is general ""beach-front"" bar and restaurant. It's not elegant; it's casual. There were lots of large families and groups. We found the food very standard - nothing fancy. I ordered a Caesar salad and the lettuce was so lukewarm and limp that I couldn't finish it. Everything else we ordered was pretty ""forgettable."" For dessert, we had the chocolate bread pudding, which sounded delicious but it was just so-so. Service was good and the staff very friendly, however, after spending $215+ for dinner for two with wine, I would expect better quality and better tasting food.",25-Jul-21,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32175-d459015-r799793197-Gar_Woods_Grill_Pier_Restaurant-Carnelian_Bay_Lake_Tahoe_California_California.html

"Very beachy look and feel, right at the water's edge. We had the Catch of the Day and it was very good (a bit expensive though). We thought the dinner should have included a bread basket. We asked for bread but they didn't have any bread at all. For dessert, the Key Lime Pie disappointed because it was doused in strawberry sauce which hid the flavor of the key lime. Service was o.k.",23-Jul-21,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34345-d1198513-r799322082-Southernmost_Beach_Cafe-Key_West_Florida_Keys_Florida.html
"As a frequent traveler and hotel snob, I pay attention to the quality of service and details. As a person who also holds status at Marriott, I received the utmost disrespect and disregard during my stay. The evening and night manager of my check in were rude, stated they would hang up the phone on me while not acknowledging their error then accused me of possible fraud with a CC that I use for 95% of my stays. Who states that they will hang up on a paying customer who is explaining this issue? They charged me twice for the same stay without my knowledge and I only recognized this after I checked my balance. Things went downhill from there. My suggestion is that they learn basic customer service and how to value loyal customers of Marriott!! Hotel etiquette 101 is recommended for those two managers!!!",25-Jul-21,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34439-d1161109-r799727341-W_South_Beach-Miami_Beach_Florida.html

"We were visiting Miami and went to Coconut Grove. We stopped at Jaguar for an early dinner. We had the Cilantro Soup, Arroz con Mariscos, and the Tijuana Caesar. All was delicious.

"We regularly eat Cuban food, so when we tried the black beans, we found them so salty that they were impossible to eat. We also had the Avocado Salad, which was fine, but was served on a warm plate. The décor, with hanging fake flowers, is just bad. It makes it look like a Polynesian restaurant. Service was slow and inattentive.

"This place doesn't have a great pub vibe. It's impersonal and more like a big cafeteria. Service was very slow and our food was lukewarm.

Attentive and elegant service provided by older gentlemen. The restaurant is not ""fancy"", rather, it is a long-established comfortable bayside experience.

"The location and decor are elegant, so we were expecting a leisurely dining experience. Instead, it felt rushed and lacking a personal touch. The food was good, but when the waiter explained the specials, we asked if the blacked fish could be prepared not blackened, and he answered, somewhat annoyed that we would have the nerve, ""no substitutions"". The wine by the glass was very expensive.

"Things were partially closed due to Covid, it was getting late, we were hungry, and a torrential downpour began. We almost went in to a bar for a quick pizza and beer, but we had looked at the menu earlier for Martino's, and decided to run through the rain to the restaurant. We were so glad we did! Everything was excellent. The Caesar salad was crispy and cold. The dressing perfect. the carbonara was superb, and the lemon cheesecake delicious. Service was very good, and the place has a small, intimate Italian vibe. Prices were reasonable.

"The staff here was great.  The resort is in good condition.  However, only one restaurant was open on property.  Was told they were having trouble with staffing.  The hotel was pretty full and to only have one restaurant was less than ideal.  There is a nice slide for the kiddos but the slide was only open 1-5pm.  Lots of activities like on the patio decks which was nice.  While there weren't clear queue lines for the valet they were super fast and friendly.  While the suites have kitchenettes there is no oven or freezer section in the fridge.

"This restaurant's location, views, and beachy fun atmosphere is great. It is largely a tourist restaurant. They don't take reservations so getting in is difficult during meal times. We went for an early dinner and got in quickly. The food was not great and our waitress was uninterested and not very attentive. Prices were very high for the food and service that we got, so just know that you are paying for the beachy location. They also don't want you to linger after your meal and have a time limit for tables, so forget hanging around after your dinner to enjoy the sunset. We heard a lot of hype about this restaurant before our trip, but we were disappointed and didn't return.",05-May-21,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60608-d3326792-r788031723-Lava_Lava_Beach_Club-Waikoloa_Kohala_Coast_Island_of_Hawaii_Hawaii.html
"This restaurant is in a strip mall so we were not expecting the very elegant décor. The food was o.k., not the best Indian cuisine we've ever had. We tried the Butter Chicken, but it was not as good as expected. The service was excruciatingly slow! We were seated right away (make reservations), but it took forever for the food to come out. I ordered a chai tea and inexplicably, they said it would take a while (why?). We were done with dinner, had already paid, and the tea still had not come out. We had to take it to go. The restaurant was not packed or anything, so just slow for some reason.",15-Apr-21,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d17398701-r786588115-Moksha_Indian_Brasserie-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html

"The restaurant is in a strip mall, but inside it's very nicely decorated. The food was very good and enjoyable, but the service was extremely SLOW! We were given a table and menus right away, then after waiting for about half hour for the server to return and take our order, one of us had to go get the server. Then another very long wait for our food to arrive, and finally, an additional long wait for the bill. We again had to go get the server. The restaurant was at a reduced capacity, and there were several servers, so It's difficult to understand why it was so slow. Because of the very SLOW service, we most likely won't return.",10-Mar-21,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58555-d4614898-r784305482-Kyoto_Japanese_Restaurant-Lakewood_Washington.html

"O.K., so an authentic Italian restaurant in Olympia is very exciting considering that the majority of the people believe Olive Garden a good Italian restaurant. This very small restaurant in a strip mall is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Some of the staff is authentically Italian (or appear to be). Decor is comfortable and appropriate. The menu is varied and the portions large. The food is traditional and very good, but it didn't ""wow"" us at first bite. However, if you want an Italian experience, do go.

"The couple of times we've been there, service has seemed harried and confusing. I ordered the corn trio (an appetizer) and a dinner. The dinners arrived, and we asked a couple of times about the corn. The server said it takes a long time to cook. Really? Please be honest with customers. It takes 5 minutes to boil corn on the cob. Who are you kidding? The corn finally arrived when we were almost done with our dinners. We also had to ask for the tortillas that were supposed to come with the dinner. Additionally, prices are steep for what you get. The corn (1 ear of corn slathered with cheese/spices) is $9.99! Everything was just so-so on taste. We won't return.",02-Nov-20,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58549-d20356384-r776319862-The_Port_Taco_Truck-Lacey_Washington.html

"Because of the COVID-19 economic impact, we specifically wanted to go to a local restaurant instead of one that is part of a large chain. We decided to stop for breakfast at The Pancake Chef. First of all, we didn't get much of a greeting on entering. The man at the register didn't even glance up. First impressions is that this is a ""has been"" restaurant, badly in need of an remodel and upgrade. The carpet is filthy and probably original to the place. A waitress dropped a bunch of salt and pepper paper packets on the carpet and proceeded to pick them up off the dirty floor and put them back for use. My breakfast was literally uneatable. The eggs were rubbery. The sourdough pancakes sounded good on the menu but were awful. The syrups came to the table in small open carafes with NO lids -- really?! Gross unsanitary condition even without a pandemic. We will NEVER return.

"Our 16 year old grandson loves pho, and not only has tried it at many restaurants, has actually made it himself many times. So when he declared Pho 111's pho the best, we had to take his word for it. We had the beef pho, chicken pho, and a Vietnamese sandwich. All was very good.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at The Overleaf. It's wonderful to read that you liked the location and overall look/feel of the property.

"We had a pleasant lunch and the wait staff was excellent. The food was very good too, specially the bread with olive oil dipping sauce. We sat outside and noted that this restaurant, with its awesome views, could use some improvements. We're not sure if building improvements are possible or affordable, but here are some ideas. The outdoor section is severely lacking. It's weird and narrow and has a dangerous step up - a serious tripping hazard for staff and guests. It's also right next to the parking lot. An outdoor deck would be such an improvement. We went inside to use the restrooms and found it very dreary and dark inside with visible decline on the wood floors, etc. Other than that, we had a nice lunch.",11-Aug-20,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d432924-r764280014-BluWater_Bistro-Seattle_Washington.html

"I am giving this restaurant the lowest rating based on their disregard for their employees' and customers' health. We stopped for breakfast on 7/17/20 and not one of the employees was wearing masks or gloves; not the server nor the cook. Inside tables were not six feet apart. Paper menus were reused. And there was no sign of hand-washing or wiping down for germs. And, some of the customers also came in not wearing masks. We should have walked out, but stayed. My French Toast was mediocre and a bit on the burned side. The Biscuits and Gravy were good and a generous portion.

The food was very, very good. We had lunch - a sandwich and the Loco Moco, a beer and a smoothie. Prices are higher than a cheap drive-in restaurant, but this is not a cheap drive-in. The owner was very nice and friendly. This also seems like a great place to meet friends for a drink.

"The Port Taco Truck is a new restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. It has very comfortable decor, including a real taco truck inside. Very interesting idea. The decor is modern with lots of light coming through big windows. The prices are not bad, and service was excellent on the day we went. This will be a nice place to go on a warm day to be able to sit outside. The menu is authentic Mexican street taco type, not your huge cheesie platters of Tex-Mex we're used to.

"Bongos is a Caribbean oasis in Seattle. This was our first time there and we loved it! The informal decor and large sandy outdoor area is so much fun. It's colorful and inviting. The food was very, very good. It's not common to find Caribbean food in the Northwest, so we were so happy to have found this. We had the pork with black beans, rice, and tostones and the picadillo. We sat outside in a sunny spot and enjoyed our meal with beers. Service was quick and friendly. It's very informal, you order at the counter. Prices were very reasonable and servings generous. We don't remember seeing desserts on the menu and that would be a great addition (flan, arroz con leche, dulce de leche, etc.) We will be back, hopefully soon!",06-Mar-20,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d6748682-r749573068-Bongos-Seattle_Washington.html
"We hadn't been to Infernos for a long time because we got bad service last time, so we thought we'd give it another try. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Friday night and it's probably because of their exorbitant pizza prices! We had a large half Hawaiian - half pepperoni and it was $28.99!!! It wasn't even giant. And to make matters worse, even before we realized what we had paid for the pizza, we both commented that it tasted as plain and ordinary as a frozen $5.99 pizza from the grocery store. We won't be back. We've got to say though that service was great and our waitress was friendly and very pleasant even though it took a long time to get out food. But really, they need to improve their pizzas AND come down on their prices.",29-Feb-20,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58549-d3256545-r748378767-Infernos_Brick_Oven_Pizza-Lacey_Washington.html

"Wow, all negative, pretty much. We entered the restaurant to a sign that says, ""Please Seat Yourself"". We headed over to a row of booths only to be told they were all reserved, but they had not had time to put out the ""Reserved"" signs. We then went towards the front of the restaurant and began taking a large booth only to be told that our party of 3 was not big enough for that booth.

The ""guacamole"" clearly came out of a processed container as it was still in the shape of the ice cream scoop. And it didn't taste anything like fresh guacamole.

"A wonderful day for a hike. The temperature was in the high 60s with a gentle breeze. There are free maps at the trail head, take one. Choose your trail based on the length you want and the difficulty level. We chose the Taliesin West overlook and came back on the Old Jeep trail. Round trip was just over 5 miles according to our map. Our step counters indicated we went about 30 percent further. The terrain is baseball sized loose gravel on medium grades. One hiker we passed called them ankle breakers.

"Even though the restaurant doesn't open until 5:00 p.m., they gave us reservations at 4:30, so we were very glad to get in at all. We received a warm welcome from the owner at the door. Service was perfect - just enough attention given without being intrusive. The food seemed authentic and very fresh. The only disappointment was the Merenghata. We've never had that before and for us, it was not an outstanding dessert. The restaurant is not elegant from the outside, but inside it is cozy and very nice. Prices seemed adequate for the service and food quality, with the exception of the $39 Halibut. That was a bit high.

We thought the food was very good, had an artichoke appetizer dip that was so good, my wife and I had the turkey club on sourdough and it was big and so good.

All would have been great except for the terrible service by the waitress (dark hair, tattoos, nose ring) First off, not a friendly greeting or much of a greeting at all. Delivered drinks, no napkins or utensils. Delivered hot tea, no sugar. Delivered sugar, no spoon. Morose attitude, looked like she would have rather been anywhere but there.

And the other dinner dishes good as well. The Dulce de Leche dessert we didn't like - it was too dry. Overall very good, including service even though they were busy.

They have a rotating craft beer selection and lots of BBQ menu items. We had beer and the black bean corn salsa and chips. We didn't try any other food. We thought the salsa could have used more of a tomato base to make it more like a real salsa. It was a bit chunky. Service was o.k., not particularly warm and friendly. There was only one other couple there sitting at the bar and the server/bartender was carrying on a conversation with them. She kept up her conversation and didn't glance our way or greet us until we sat down. Nice neighborhood spot, but out the way for us. We probably won't return. Oh, and outdoor seating would be nice.

"We took our 11 1/2 year old grandson on a visit to the USS Turner Joy and were done just around lunchtime. Luckily there was Anthony's Restaurant just a short walk away! We had a very good lunch; everything was excellent. We had the Crab Salad, Salmon Bowl, and our grandson had the mac and cheese. The bread that came with the meal was very good. Service was attentive and very good.

"After the new grand opening at the Oyster House, we went and were very pleased. However, we're sad to say, it seems to be going downhill fast. The service was excruciatingly slow. Granted, they seemed to be short-handed, as the bartender and hostess were waiting on tables. We waited so long for our food, I was going to walk over to the kitchen to ask about it! Then the food came and it was a big disappointment. Whoever made the Crab Louie Salad did a very poor job. Presentation was awful. It was served in a small soup-type bowl and it was just uninspired. It looked like something someone would whip up quickly at home. The other order, Wedge Salad, came with the wrong dressing and when it was corrected, did not have enough of the correct dressing. Prices are outrageously high for the quality, presentation, and service. Come on, Oyster House! Get some excellent chefs in there and step up your game. We really like to see local establishments succeed, but sadly we won't be back anytime soon.",04-Jul-19,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d464218-r686855596-Olympia_Oyster_House-Olympia_Washington.html

"The real saving grace and reason we were somewhat satisfied with this buffet is that the price of the buffet includes wine and beer - at no extra cost! Otherwise, food selections were very limited compared to other buffets. And the taste of the food was pretty bland overall. Service was excellent though. Our server was quick to remove used dishes. And we also were happy with the pasta chef who cooks up your requests. Total: $75 for the two of us, not including tip. We ate o.k., and were able to have 3 beers and 3 glasses of wine with our dinner.",01-Jul-19,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d492192-r685864111-Cravings_Buffet-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html
"We visited in the afternoon and spent about 1 hour looking at the stacked up signs. It was mostly a boneyard of rusty, broken, nostalgic signs. A big improvement would be placing plaques near each sign with its history. We really had no idea what we were looking at. I read just now that this info is available online so I guess the info we wanted was available on our smartphones. Nobody told us that when we visited. We also were not there when tours were offered. What’s the no camera rule? We visited on 6/14 and everyone was talking photos. And the price wouldn’t be a problem if the display was better. Nice facility and gift shop - now improve the actual displays!",01-Jul-19,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d110193-r685765880-The_Neon_Museum-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html
"This was our first (and our last) visit to the Metropolitan Grill. We were looking forward to an outstanding dinner based on its ranking and the reviews. Atmosphere and service were great, however, every single dish was a huge disappointment: Bread - not fresh, not warm, no balsamic vinegar or olive oil. Lobster bisque - lukewarm and I've had much better. Almond scallops - scalloped apparently sliced thinly in half and tasted dry and mostly of parmesan cheese. Crab and prawn fettuccine - sauce too thin and watery, prawns not cooked through (disgusting!) We've had way better! Iceberg wedge - too much dressing - soaking in it. Charred cauliflower - unimpressive and dry. And our final attemp - Chocolate Lava - hard and dry on the outside and over cooked, and it would have been much better with vanilla ice cream. We shared it and couldn't even finish it because it was so hard. Total $150+ for a very, very disappointing meal!",17-Jun-19,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d432615-r682190811-Metropolitan_Grill-Seattle_Washington.html

"We were visiting the Farmer's Market and stopped at Cutters for an early dinner. Every single food item was beyond delicious! And our server, Ioanna, was charming, efficient, and really made our experience a very pleasant one! We had the California Roll, Market Chop salad, Scallops, and Seafood Mac and Cheese. Everything was very delicious, well prepared and served. We ended the meal sharing the -- also delicious -- Key Lime pie. Because we went early we were able to sit next to the windows and enjoy the beautiful view. That was an extra bonus. The restaurant is very large and it probably gets noisy and difficult to get a view table, so if possible, go at off-hours. All in all, we had a wonderful meal made even better by an excellent server!

"Our young teenage grandson is a picky eater but he has agreed to try different ethnic foods -- first attempt was Japanese food. He had heard of the carousel sushi places, so thought it would be fun to try that. He thought it was o.k., but we thought it was very mediocre. In addition to getting sushi off the conveyor belt, we ordered Miso soup and Chicken Fried Rice - both were below standard as far as quality and taste. The Miso soup was pretty tasteless and the fried rice was very greasy. The sushi was just so-so.

"We were heading home to Olympia and took the ""old"" hwy instead of the freeway. We saw Verrazano's and stopped for dinner, and were generally very pleased. I had the Spaghetti and Meatballs, and we shared the Wedge Salad -- both excellent. My husband had the Pepperoni Pizza. He didn't like the pizza crust and was very unhappy with his pizza. It had a thin crust and had scorched slightly on the bottom. However, the rest of the meal, including the warm bread, was delicious. Portions were so large we took almost half of it home. Service was pleasant. The view is very nice, the atmosphere is elegant, with tables with white tablecloths and napkins.

"Being from the Northwest, Cajun food is something I wasn't very familiar with. We saw the sign for the restaurant off Martin Way and thought we'd give it a try. Everything was absolutely delicious! We had the pulled pork Po' Boy, the basket of ribs and boudin ball, sides of cheese grits and shrimp (my absolute favorite!), and collard greens. The owner was friendly and delightful. The location and small restaurant are nothing fancy; this is just an awesome place ""to get something to eat"" or to take out. The menu is large, but the owner cooks only several items per day which is a good thing as it makes everything fresh and cooked just for you. We will definitely be back. I think I'm hooked on the grits and can't wait to try the beignets!",19-Apr-19,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d12870780-r667630435-Sensational_Cajun-Olympia_Washington.html
"This was our first time trying out not only Turkish food, but the Mediterranean Breeze restaurant. We had the combo dish with beef and chicken and the chicken curry. We love Indian food, so my taste buds immediately compared my curry, and sorry, but I found this food very bland. The bread also was not super good as far as fresh bread goes. It was like a big bagel. Portions were generous and service was outstanding. Even though this restaurant is in a strip mall, it's very large inside and feels nice and relatively upscale. The menu is big and varied, with lots of lamb dishes, but the dinners were in the very expensive range -- too expensive for the location, atmosphere, and food. We won't be back.",13-Apr-19,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d8397374-r666031137-Mediterranean_Breeze-Olympia_Washington.html

The atmosphere is casual, but beware that prices are a bit on the high side for Olympia. One negative is that when we asked about the source of the salmon they said it was Atlantic Farm Raised. Our out-of-town guest was looking forward to ordering Northwest salmon, so he was disappointed.

"From Seattle, you can feel the refreshing, crisp air that imbues and rejuvenates the spirit during the drive through the Cascade Mountains on the way to Sun Mountain Lodge in Winthrop. Sun Mountain Lodge is a higher-end lodging destination nestled within view of majestic mountains and the expanse of the great outdoors. When we traveled there in late May/early June, the weather was just comfortable enough for an informative nature hike offered by knowledgeable hotel staff of the local, blossoming flora. We were also able to attend the colorful, local rodeo in Winthrop that weekend. However, by far, we had the most fun on the hotel sponsored cowboy horseback ride to a specially catered outdoors BBQ dinner on Saturday evening. It was a load of fun and very scenic with lots of wildlife along the way. The food was simply delicious and we all sang camp fire songs after dinner that was led by a troubadour with his guitar. For those of limited mobility, there is a horse-drawn wagon option to the BBQ location.  And if this is not enough, Winthrop also offered an old fashioned Western Barn Dance in town. All-in-all I recommend the Sun Mountain Lodge as your anchoring point for these fun, family-oriented, activities. Sun Mountain Lodge also offers a splendid smorgasbord of other activities from floating down the river, to mountain climbing, to hunting. The staff were very professional and the lodging is ideally situated to facilitate a memorable vacation stay. I would stay here again in a minute. Oh, did I forget to mention that this multiple award winning facility has excellent dining facilities? There is a reason Sun Mountain Lodge has won AAA Four Diamond status year-after-year. At some point in your life, do yourself a favor and take a vacation here.

Atmosphere was just o.k., For this pricey place, I would have dressed this up a little bit -- use white tablecloths, real wood floor, better decor. One negative to our dining experience was that our waitress removed our plates without asking if we were done -- just whisked them away. Please ask. I wasn't quite done.

It was saturated with dressing to the point that I was not able to finish it. When we mentioned it to the waitress her response was, ""That's because we use 3 different kind of blue cheese"". So?

"My wife and I visited the rainforest on a warm sunny day in late July, which seems to be prime tourist season. We arrived at about 9:30 AM and the parking lot was quickly filling up. The Hoh Visitor Center is a good spot to get general info about the rainforest and talk to a ranger about camping and hiking opportunities. There a three trails emanating from the Visitor Center: the very short “Hall of Mosses” loop, the slightly longer “Spruce Nature” loop, and the long Hoh River Trail that runs over 18 miles to a glacier. The loops were very crowded and noisy. But once we stepped off onto the River Trail, the crowds disappeared, the foliage looked lusher and more amazing, and the whole experience took on a more mystical quality. Epiphytic moss seemed more abundant on these Sitka Spruce trees than those in the short loop trails (photo 1). We even found a short trail — only 1 mile down the main trail — leading to sand bars on the river, where we had gorgeous views of the river and rainforest (photo 2). We think what turned most people away from the River Trail was the 18 miles listed as its full length. But you don’t have to walk the entire trail before being enchanted by the amazing beauty of the rainforest.",10-Aug-18,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g143047-d104771-r604994953-Hoh_Rain_Forest-Olympic_National_Park_Washington.html

"We got off the Water Taxi, and Bokampers was the first place we saw, so we went in for dinner. The decor is that of a sports bar. We sat outside on the deck with a view of the water. Our waiter was awesome! He was friendly and definitely wanted to make sure we had a great time. The menu is a bit large and hard to figure out -- lots of choices: sushi, pizza, burgers, sides, entrees, etc., etc. We had sushi and a side of Mac and Cheese, and black beans and rice. All was great with the exception of the ""Black Beans and Rice"". We were expecting Cuban-style beans and rice, but this was spicy and more Cajun. We finished with Key Lime Pie and declared it the best so far!",20-Jul-18,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d5534614-r597863521-Bokampers_Sports_Bar_Grill-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html

We sat outside in the back which was very cozy. Our waitress was wonderful. She explained all the dishes and was friendly and efficient. We were so pleased until... the food arrived. My swordfish was a bit overcooked, and the special of the day, lasagna, was very heavy and also tasted overdone.

It was next to the window, however, the window was filthy. It was not only spotted with water spots; it had a large black streak. So much for enjoying the view! Service was excellent and elegant -- thanks to Jose and the bus person (I didn't get his name).

My husband and I visited Fremont Street a few days ago at night and it was awesome lots of street performers to watch a few bands playing on the stages and zip lining up above. with that being said it was also sad to see all the people with small children down there until all hours being surrounded with half naked women and people walking around smoking marijuana. there are plenty of stores along the walkway that you can just go in and buy two beers they will put it in a plastic cup for you and you can walk around with it on the street. ,08-Jun-18,10,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d102514-r586041732-Fremont_Street_Experience-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html

The small fountain in front, the fireplace, games, and books, the outdoor seating, and the open atmosphere are perfect. The menu consists of pub food, with an upscale twist (they also have a children's menu). They have their own brewed beer, plus local beers on tap. We tried the Artesian IPA and the Volle Pulle! Both excellent. We had the Roasted Garlic Tomato soup, the Oly Style Drive-in burger, and the Tempura Chicken Bites and fries. Everything was excellent. Our server was great.

"The decor is great but not intimate. Prepare to sit very close to your neighbors. The food was excellent and the portions were large enough to share. It is expensive -- they charge for bread typically provided free of charge in nice restaurants, and automatically add on a 20% service charge (tip). I had the halibut, which was good, but was tiny for the $30 price tag.

At one point, both bartenders/waitstaff left the bar area for approximately 10 minutes, leaving new customers to wander in and look around in confusion. Our simple order of two appetizers took more than 30 minutes to come out, while our beer glasses sat empty.

"This was our first time at Ricardo's Restaurant. We went for Happy Hour, and while we thought everything was very good, the food was not excellent (lettuce could have been colder, was lobster bisque homemade or did it come out of a carton from Trader Joe's?, etc). And it was very expensive for a Happy Hour! The atmosphere is very upscale with a mix of industrial and eclectic, but it comes off very nicely. The restaurant and bar were very busy, and as we sat at the bar, we noticed a buzz of confusion/inexperience among the staff. It didn't affect our dining experience necessarily, but it made us wonder about the general service should we have been there for a nice dinner or a special occasion. Another ""weird"" thing was the man (owner?) wearing huge gold necklaces and medallions reminiscent of disco days. That was just weird. I don't know that we'll be back -- maybe we'll go on a nice day to be able to sit outside in the front patio by the fireplace for a drink. Otherwise, at these expensive prices, we would probably go somewhere else where we know we would get not only excellent food, but excellent service.",10-Feb-18,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58549-d2178213-r559607074-Ricardo_s_Restaurant-Lacey_Washington.html

We had beer and Caesar Salad, French Onion soup, Tempura Prawns, and Flatbread Caprese from the Happy Hour menu. Everything was excellent and delicious. Our waitress, Kia, was awesome! The only negative we have about Hop Jack's is that it was super loud in there just from people's conversations and that the dining area lacks ""atmosphere"". It seems more like a diner.

"We stopped by on a Friday evening for dinner - our first time there. We love the location and the name. The decor is very nice and perfect for this neighborhood pub. The food was very good and the server very attentive. Things we would improve on: 1) Menu - add items to the menu. The menu is very limited and simple. Add a signature dish to encourage return visits. And, to make it a fun place to go to for a drink and snack, add substantial appetizers, for examples Nachos. 2) Try to decrease noise. The restaurant is small and packed, so it was very noisy. 3) Do something about the cold/rain which will come in every time someone enters or leaves. It will not be comfortable for those sitting at tables near the door. 4) If possible, add tables to the outside sidewalk area. It would be nice to sit outside on a nice day. It's great so see a local neighborhood restaurant.

(Although people to ""save"" chairs and tables by throwing towels on them and not showing up til later) You are steps away from the beach, which was very convenient.  The tiki bar was nice, reasonably priced for being on the beach!  We did not eat at the restaurant.  A few cons, the unit is not perfect.  The bathroom was clean but a little dated.  The water was difficult to turn off, if not careful the faucet would run constantly.  The water would go from very cold to hot and back to cold, not with every shower but happened a couple times to us.  The kitchen has the essentials but no extras.  We needed a baking dish for something and they did not have one.

The dishes here are delicious and well prepared. We were very pleasantly surprised. We were two adults and had the buffet, plus a glass of wine each.

We specifically made reservations at Shenanigan's because we wanted a nice dining experience on our special day. However, everything was mediocre at best. We had asked for a view table and were seated by the windows at the end of the bar. (Dirty windows, by the way) It was a loud area with a huge birthday party right next to us. Service was just o.k., nothing exceptional. The servers all looked kind of haggard and overwhelmed. The food was average. We asked if there were any specials or a fresh sheet, and the answer was no -- amazing for a summer Saturday night in a seafood restaurant!

"You really don't think of touring Venice and carrying your beachwear around so Lido would not be your first spot to see. But if you want to spend time relaxing....the beaches are beautiful. The promenade for walkers and bikers is super. After walking our feet off in Venice, we took full advantage of the transit system. The #2 boat to Lido took around 45 minutes. We asked which way to the beach and were pointed in the direction. We luckily saw a standing bus, C (v is also good) and hopped on for two stops. It runs every 10 mins. It would have been a really long walk on a hot summer's day. There are cabanas and showers, don't know how expensive but check before you go.  The beach strip was empty and it was a gorgeous summer weekday. We took the #6 express boat back to p del Roma.

People get up in the middle of the show as a matter of course, they do not necessarily stay quiet during the show and they appear to be able to bring quite large items of 'luggage' into the theatre.

"We visited on a cold, rainy day in April and it seemed appropriate for the occasion. If you buy your tickets online, you can avoid the lines (the ticket machines were not working the day we went so everyone had to use the ticket windows). Give yourself a good 3-4 hours to experience this memorial. It is very well done but as an interior designer, my one complaint is the signage. WHY are they SO SMALL? There are HUGE walls everywhere in the memorial and the areas around displays are ample yet they have SMALL signs with tiny writing. You have people crowding to read a sign when there's 15 feet of vertical space on a wall or the sign easily could have been 3 or 4 times the size so it could actually BE READ.

"I'm giving Pizza Casa a very good rating with a few caveats. The food and service were excellent; the atmosphere so-so. Don't expect a fancy restaurant. Starting with the location - right off I-5 in a not-so-safe looking area. We had to park in the rear between the next door Mexican restaurant and the railroad tracks. The restaurant's windows look out at the cars parked in front, with a view of I-5 traffic back-ups as a background; the building is hugged by the railroad tracks in the back.

"Large, dark pub-like atmosphere. We went for breakfast and thought the food was pretty mediocre. I had the Eggs Benedict. They were good, but the hash browns were lukewarm and tasted like they were made from leftovers or had been sitting for a while. My husband had the biscuits and gravy and said they were just so-so. Service was slow and not overly friendly.

"We've been going to Whistler since the late 1980s and had never been to the Rimrock Cafe. From the road, the Cafe doesn't look like much, and because it's not in the village, we just never thought to go there. However, based on the reviews on TripAdvisor, we decided to venture out and have a nice dinner there this year. Were we glad!!! We were beyond delighted! The ""non-descript"" look from the outside hides the beautiful log architecture inside. The decor is elegant, yet warm and welcoming. Our waitress, Shelley, was excellent! She made us feel very special, and you could tell from her service that she really enjoys her work. Dinner was fantastic. We had the Caesar Salad and the Chevre and Beets, the Seafood Trio and Lobster dinners, and ended with the most delicious dessert ever: Sticky Pudding with vanilla ice cream. The dinners came with a starch and vegetables, and baskets of bread. Don't EVEN think about calories while enjoying dinner there! Yes, the prices are steep. Our dinner for two with a glass of wine each came to $200CAN with the tip. But, it is definitely worth it if you are looking for a fine place to dine.

"We were excited to have dinner at 21 Steps and made reservations for 5:30p.m. The restaurant opens at 5:30, and there was a long line waiting to get in. But because we had reservations, we were seated right away. The ambiance and decor are not impressive. There are lots of tables in one big room. We were lucky to be seated by a window, because otherwise we would have been in the middle of the room with nothing but diners around us. The windows look down on the Village Stroll and have no mountain views to speak of. Service was good. The food was o.k., not excellent. I had the Tiger Prawns and Sea Scallops. I thought the prawns were more the size of shrimp, so it was disappointing. My husband had the salmon and he said it was great. They charge $2 for the bread basket. The dessert, Apple Caramel Crumble with ice cream, was honestly - terrible. We were not impressed. We won't be returning. And, take note, like many places in Whistler, there is no elevator, so avoid going there if you have mobility issues. There really are 21 steps. .",25-Feb-17,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g154948-d681615-r462787566-21_Steps_Kitchen_Bar-Whistler_British_Columbia.html

"The concept of Farm & Craft is healthy and sustainable food. First the location: Great corner spot with lots of outdoor seating and openness. Lots of action passing by. The wait time to get an outdoor table was about 1/2 hr on a late Friday evening, so make reservations. We didn't want to sit inside because the A/C was on and it was quite cool. With our group of four people, two loved the food and two thought is was just o.k. We had the sweet potato carrot puree. Mine had lumps in it and it tasted mostly of carrot (baby food taste). The Farro Mac and Cheese was weird, but again, we didn't know what to expect and are not very adventurous eaters. The pineapple and bacon flatbread was good. Service was friendly and very good.

Service was too informal for us (referring to my elderly mom and me as ""girls"") and lacking in attentiveness. We were pretty much left alone, had just finished our entrees, when the waitress plopped the bill on the table.

Our kids, ages 9 and 12, declared the place ""fancy"" and the younger one even put on an English accent to underscore the fact. The menu is excellent, portions were huge, and everything was great. Baskets of bread and sweet bread loaf for dinner and breakfast added to the meals.

We were immediately greeted on entering, and the waitstaff was attentive without being intrusive. The wine list is extensive. The menu consists of items not typically found in Olympia: snails, pate, pork belly, foie gras, duck, lamb, as well as beef and chicken dishes. There is also a special prix fixe dinner most evenings. Prices are very, very high, but the food was plentiful and excellent. Be aware that there is no children's menu, however, we were told that the chef will prepare something special if requested. Make sure you make reservations as the restaurant is small. Service was European-slow, so take your time and enjoy your meal. This is a great restaurant for special occasions, or more often if you can afford that sort of thing. We had dinner for two with a $50+ bottle of wine, one salad, one French Onion soup, the two ",24-Dec-16,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d2102713-r446469774-La_Petite_Maison-Olympia_Washington.html
"The artwork here is beautiful.  The visit is a bit pricey, but the pieces we saw were worth it, in my opinion!  It’s a great way to kill a few hours during a rainy afternoon! They offer a combined pass that includes entrance to the Space Needle, so I recommend getting that if you haven't yet purchased either ticket, because it's cheaper than buying the Chihuly Gardens ticket and the Space Needle ticket separately!",20-Dec-16,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d3184389-r445731754-Chihuly_Garden_and_Glass-Seattle_Washington.html
"This is tasty, well-prepared traditional Mexican food. Lots of sauces offered for tasting. The chips were very good. Portions are much smaller than the run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurants.

"Romul's is nicely decorated in an Italian décor; although a little bit too much. It could benefit by getting rid of some, specially the knick-knack items. Service was friendly and efficient. The background music was delightful (if you like Bocelli and Josh Groban; we do). Everything was great as we started with red wine and the delicious warm bread. However, when the food arrived, we were very disappointed. The spaghetti sauce was lacking in flavor. It was just a thin tomato sauce. No taste of garlic, oregano, basil, onions, etc. as we expected. The Crapese salad would have been more enjoyable with the tomatoes at room temperature rather than cold from the refrigerator. Then finally, the dessert. We had the flourless chocolate cake with gelato. The cake was awful! It wasted like wax. We could not eat it. Prices were very high for the bland food. We hope the owner reads this and the cook begins utilizing lots of Italian spices. It was a nice place with nice staff, so we wish them well. But like so many other reviews have said, the food needs to improve!",30-Nov-16,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51909-d3366672-r441217198-Romul_s-Hood_River_Oregon.html

"This was our first visit to Bob's. We went for a late lunch and sat in the bar. The place is similar to the Ram or similar type of restaurant/pub. They have a good selection of local beer. The bar has many TVs with the sound on, so that was a bit annoying. Service was not stellar. I am going to blame that on sitting in the bar where the bartender was doing double-duty as a server. The food was pretty good, but not excellent. All in all, I'd say an o.k. place.",14-Nov-16,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58693-d6214634-r437239180-Bob_s_Burgers_and_Brew-Puyallup_Washington.html
"We had dinner at the Waterstreet Café yesterday. Everything was excellent -- from the friendly greeting at the door, to the service, and the food. The restaurant is not inexpensive, but it's appropriate for the experience. The only negative is that the menu is rather small. For example, salmon was the only seafood on the menu. However, the entrée choices all sounded excellent; it was hard to pick out one.

"This was my second visit to The Creperie. On this day, workers had the main entrance blocked off and the restaurant's sign pointed to a side door. However, the side door was locked. Finally, after much knocking, the waitperson came and said she couldn't let us in that way and we had to go around. We told her it was blocked. Finally we were let in. The restaurant was totally empty. We asked if we could sit by the window in one of the larger tables and were told no, they held those for larger groups (Empty restaurant and 11am, so that was bad customer service). As we ate, we saw several customers dealing with the issue with the doors (going around outside back and forth). The three staff at the restaurant were made aware of this, but acted powerless to do anything, and unconcerned. The whole experience of eating there had a robotic quality to it. The waitperson was somewhat efficient, but that's about it. No smile, no pleasantries. We had to ask for more coffee, for empty plates to be removed from the miniscule table, for our check. The food and coffee are really good. Now they just need the staff to get training in Customer Service, and actually act like they are happy to be there.",05-Nov-16,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d10642923-r434835270-The_Creperie-Olympia_Washington.html
"We were intrigued about the new ramen restaurant in downtown Olympia, so we stopped for dinner. The decor is new/modern and very nice. Parking was available on the street (free after 5p.m.) and there is also an underground parking garage. We had the Spicy Ramen and the Vegetable Ramen, plus the Tempura Vegetables as an appetizer. Unfortunately, we realized this is not really our type of food. (Unless the dinner comes with a bread basket, it's not dinner). The ramen was o.k., not great. It's difficult and messy to eat if you're not good at using chopsticks. The very limited menu does not offer Sushi or Teriyaki, so beware, ramen is about it. The beer selection was very small. Service was very good and attentive. However, we won't be back. This just isn't our thing.",18-Oct-16,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d10520100-r429285663-Kizuki_Ramen_Izakaya-Olympia_Washington.html
"Trapper's Sushi is not a traditional Japanese restaurant, and the menu appears to have some non-traditional sushi inventions cleverly named after NW locations. We had a great time trying several different ones and liked them all. The décor is modern and the restaurant is relatively small. It's hard to tell where the sushi bar, the regular bar, and the dining areas end. Service was pleasant and good. The restaurant has a number of ""all you can eat"" specials, so check out the website for the best time to go. We finished our sushi dinner with delicious Mochi ice cream; a round ball of ice cream covered in rice paper. Yummy!

"We had an early lunch of the Ham, Egg, and Swiss cheese, and the Bacon, Tomato, and Basil crepes. The food was excellent and very tasty. The décor is upscale ""vintage French."" The Creperie is half restaurant - half store with some very beautiful items for sale. The atmosphere is comfortable with lots of natural light from the many windows facing the street. There is very limited seating - just several tables. Service was prompt and friendly. A suggestion for improvement is to add the drinks to the menu, since we had to ask. There are a lot of options for drinks, so it would be nice to have them written on the menu. We'll definitely return and try the other crepes. The hours of The Creperie are limited, so check if they are open before you go.

"This little corner authentic Mexican food restaurant is right next door to Fish Tale Ales. We had heard it was good, so we went for lunch on a Thursday. It was very busy, with a line of people out the door. A lot of people were ordering food to go at the counter. We were able to grab a booth. The large basket of chips was disappointing. They tasted greasy and stale. Our food was so-so. The flour tortillas were hard on the edges. Service was not good. We had a couple of different waitresses serving us at different times. We had to ask for refills and utensils. Then it took forever to get our bill and to be able to pay since you pay at the counter along with the long line of take-out customers.

"Stayed for one night over the weekend with family (my husband and three-year-old son, as well as my senior mother.)  I don't recommend the hotel if you're traveling with kids to be honest.  There is one pool, it's not very large, and a lot of guests who do bring older kids or teens leave them at the pool and don't seem to be anywhere in sight, so the pool is packed and rowdy.  There are no lifeguards and guests under 21 can't be in the pool area after 7pm.  There's not much else do to on site if you're with a kid while others are gambling, there's a large lawn, but nothing is provided to entertain kids on the lawn (I've stayed at other venues where there are lawn games out, an arcade area, etc.) That said, a casino isn't typically a kid-oriented venue in the first place, so I don't knock the place for not being kid friendly.

Dinner came with a couple of baskets of bread with pesto dipping sauce. Portions were huge. Service was friendly and efficient. We sat in the bar / indoor restaurant area and the vibe was energetic, yet relaxed and comfortable. Some of the staff is Italian which adds to the experience and lets you practice Italian, if you know some. For dessert, we shared the tiramisu al limoncello, and it did not ""wow"". It was just o.k.

"I am Cuban and love Cuban food, so while visiting San Diego, I was happy to find Andre's. Unfortunately, this restaurant missed the mark on every single thing! Let's start with our waitress. She was not welcoming or friendly at all. I spoke to her in Spanish, and she responded in English. I eventually asked her if she spoke Spanish, and she said, no, she speaks Portuguese. (Next time, please inform your customers that you don't speak Spanish). Next, the décor. It is generic at best. There is not a single thing that indicates that this is a Caribbean restaurant. The food: they were out of the Arroz con Pollo even though it was not late in the evening. They don't serve Mojitos, Cuba Libres, or Daquiris. They serve only beer and wine. The bread that came with the meal was not good. The yucca and tostones were thin and overcooked. And the presentation of the food was simple and uninspired. The two croquetas came in a tiny bowl with no condiments or anything. We ordered a salad which they forgot to bring out, so we canceled it. And they brought the check out without offering or asking if we wanted coffee or dessert. As a matter of fact, we did want the flan, which turned out to be disappointing. In addition to the not-so-friendly waitress, the other waiter was Mexican. Maybe what this place needs is to have Cuban staff. And the last unpleasant thing about the evening, is that they bring a credit card machine to the table where you are forced to select the tipping amount while the wait staff stands there watching. So, disappointing décor, staff, food, and service. Stay away.",09-Aug-16,10,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d456493-r403443836-Andre_s_Cuban_Restaurant-San_Diego_California.html

The beer on tap selection is good. The menu has some interesting items; not just the same American pub fare. The Happy Hour menu is limited, but still has some good selections. The only negative for us was that it took a very long time after ordering to get our food -- I'm talking, like 30 - 45 minutes. But once the food arrived, all tasted great. We got frequent refills on our drinks, so we were pleased with the service -- just the kitchen needs to speed up.

We said yes, expecting her to take our order. Instead she said, ""Good because I need these menus back"". She took the menus and with that she was gone.

"We have to say we were impressed - the décor and ambience of the Twisted Cuban Café & Bar really hits the mark. There are large photographs of Cuba on the walls, and it really feels authentic (specially the chairs and stools). The restaurant has some outdoor seating, however, it is located right next to a busy, noisy road, so eating outside is not very pleasant. We were greeted warmly and service was great. We know Cuban food very well and were excited by the authentic items on the menu. But unfortunately the food was a big disappointment. The black beans were watery and tasteless. Traditional Cuban black beans are cooked until thick with olive oil, red wine, onions, green peppers, garlic, cumin, etc. These were terrible. The roast pork was pretty good. The fish, so-so. We also ordered ham croquetas which were not very good. For dessert we had flan and the Cascos de Guayaba. The flan was delicious. The cascos, always red, were yellow (WHAT???) and not very good. And the traditional finish to a Cuban meal: strong, sweet Cuban Coffee, was awful. It was watery and weak; so bad we couldn't even drink it all. This restaurant is owned by a Cuban. We really would like to see it succeed. BUT, the food is not good enough. My recommendation is to get pre-Castro recipes for Cuban food, get advice from local Cubans, and improve. Good luck.",15-Jul-16,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58835-d934518-r392893211-Twisted_Cuban_Cafe_Bar-Woodinville_Washington.html

"The Anthony's at the Old Mill is in an excellent location, next to the river. The outdoor section is great, large and sunny. The staff though needs some finesse. It took a long time to get our food. Our waitresses changed mid-meal. A group of staff (manager, maybe?) was deep cleaning the chairs/umbrellas and discussing cleaning methods next to customers. Leave that for off-hours, o.k.? Customers want a relaxing time and meal, not to hear about your cleaning woes.",01-Jul-16,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51766-d6627487-r388159986-Anthony_s_at_the_Old_Mill-Bend_Central_Oregon_Oregon.html
"Pelican Brewing is a fun pub. It's large with nice contemporary décor, some outside seating, and plenty of parking. The food portions are generous. We liked the food even though we sent word back to the kitchen that everything was too salty. The beer is good. Service was fine; it just needs a little fine-tuning since they are new. The place has a comfortable, open feeling -- a nice addition to dining at Cannon Beach.",30-Jun-16,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51790-d10317236-r387962730-Pelican_Brewing_Cannon_Beach-Cannon_Beach_Oregon.html

Stayed on the top floor and it was very quiet and peaceful. Room was large and very clean. Breakfast provided was pretty good. Could see the mountains (when the weather was clear enough). A short walk across the river to the Old Mill district for evening meals if you didn't want to drive anywhere.,01-Jul-16,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51766-d6914710-r387999371-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Bend-Bend_Central_Oregon_Oregon.html
"Parkstone Wood Kitchen is a noisy, active place. We had an excellent waiter who explained everything and took good care of us. We had the corn on the cob, corn bread, wedge salad, sweet potatoes, fries, mac and cheese, and beer of course. Everything was very good. We liked the atmosphere and the extra nice touch of cloth napkins.

"After walking around and looking at the many souvenir shops and fish processing sites on Bay Blvd., we were pleased to find a nicer, more upscale restaurant for dinner. Local Ocean Seafoods has a beautiful view of the marina and the bridge. The atmosphere is modern and upscale, yet very comfortable. There is a fish counter where you can purchase the catch of the day, seating by open large doors, and a bar with stools to sit and watch the cooks. Upstairs there is a nice looking bar and more dining tables. This restaurant has an elevator which is very nice for those that can't do the stairs. The food was excellent. We had the Fish Wrap and the Tuna Burger. Service was pleasant and efficient. Prices were appropriate - dinner for two with one beer and a soft drink = $38. We will definitely go back when in Newport.",29-Jun-16,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51992-d643438-r387647546-Local_Ocean_Seafoods-Newport_Oregon.html
"We didn't know what to expect of the Pine Tavern. It looks like a small older tavern from the outside. TripAdvisor reviews were good, so we decided to give it a try. The food was excellent. We had the fettuccini which was large enough to share. They brought out small scones with honey butter that are worth going there just for those! Delicious! We had salads and the onion soup -- all great as well. We sat at a booth at the bar. There was additional dining room seating in back, as well as outside with a view of the river. The food portions were large, so unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert. We saw a berry cobbler with ice cream being served nearby and we were sorry we couldn't have it. Prices and service all good.

"We sat outside on a nice evening and received excellent service. The food was very good but very expensive. I had the shrimp and lobster curry. It didn't have any big pieces of lobster, and had three or four pieces of shrimp. At $24, it seemed very costly compared to other places we've had a similar dish. We also had two types of sushi: a tuna flight and a California Roll for a total of $36! Everything was tasty, but realistically, we've eaten at many Asian restaurants and these prices just seemed over the top. And for that reason, we won't return.",28-Jun-16,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51766-d2009757-r387275686-Five_Fusion_Sushi_Bar-Bend_Central_Oregon_Oregon.html

"The atmosphere of Oly Underground is very comfortable. There are plenty of bar stools, tables and chairs, and even a couch and comfy chairs. There are two nice pool tables. The décor is appropriate for a bar and local hangout. This was our first time there. We tried the nachos and the teriyaki chicken burger. The food was mediocre/bad. The nachos were cold when served. The bun on the burger did not look nor taste fresh. Service was bad in that once the food got served nobody checked on us again. We even had to get up and ask for the bill. My husband said it was too bad they didn't come and check on us because he would have liked to have ordered another beer. We also could have used a knife, and more napkins and salsa. So, service - poor. Food - mediocre/bad. Beer selection on tap - very few. Ambience - local hangout for the younger crowd.",18-Jun-16,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d10445333-r383836094-Oly_Underground-Olympia_Washington.html
"The Martin Way Diner has the old-fashioned comfortable look you would expect of a diner. We stopped there for Saturday morning breakfast, and it was excellent. The portions are plentiful and the staff is friendly, fast, and efficient. The menu, food, and the prices are what you would expect in a diner. They have daily specials in food and drinks. So, if you want a really good ""home-style"" meal, in a comfortable informal setting go there; you won't go wrong.",05-Jun-16,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d1971903-r379964480-Martin_Way_Diner-Olympia_Washington.html
"We were going to Seattle and looked on Tripadvisor for good places to stop on the way to eat breakfast. TripAdvisor reviews of Biscuits Café were great, so we went. We were underwhelmed. The location and décor are just so-so. It has tables and booths, but the crowded groupings of tables reminded us of a cafeteria. There were a few tables outside. The music was annoyingly loud. The service was o.k. - nothing outstanding. And the food was mediocre and servings not huge. I would rate this restaurant as similar to eating at a Denny's or Shari's.",02-Jun-16,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58471-d7653816-r379201893-Biscuits_Cafe-Federal_Way_Washington.html
"We went during Happy Hour to grab something to eat before a show at the Key Arena. The Happy Hour menu doesn't have lots of items, but we were able to get a salad and Salmon Tartine. Everything was very tasty and the portions were generous. My husband ordered off the main menu - the Palace Burger Royale. It was big and came with a huge mound of fries. The only minor complaint (and he didn't say anything to the waitress) was that it was not cooked all the way through. It was very pink. Décor is interesting and very ""Seattle"". It is rather dark in there with chandeliers and a beautiful wall mural. The seating at the booths is very dark; if you prefer light, seating by the windows is best. Prices are not cheap - $18.50 for the burger. And BEWARE! there is a 20% Service Charge added to the bill for ""wages, sales commissions, benefits and revenue share."" ??? That just seemed weird. Restaurant wages and benefits should be paid by the restaurant management; not directly by the customers. That just hit a negative nerve with us. The Service Charge is instead of tips; but that defeats the purpose of giving a tip for excellent service. If you do decide to go for dinner, check out the menus online. We didn't see a lot of entrees we would have picked; but then again, we're not very adventurous eaters.",02-Jun-16,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d463485-r379204899-Palace_Kitchen-Seattle_Washington.html
"This restaurant is right on the main road to Crystal Mountain so it's an excellent stop, specially for breakfast. Décor is homey with lots of Coca Cola items. Service was attentive and excellent. My husband had the Biscuits and Gravy with hashbrowns. He said everything was excellent. I had the Monte Christie with hashbrowns. It was just o.k. The hashbrowns were cold. The coffee is the typical diner-tasting coffee. This is an o.k. homestyle-cooking type place - nothing to rave about.",24-May-16,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58462-d1914823-r376130515-Charlie_s_Cafe-Enumclaw_Washington.html

The building is part of the ever expanding Miami Dade college now. If you are visiting Miami and want to check it out get on the Metro-mover and take the Omni loop [the guard at government center will direct you to the proper mover]. The mover is free. Get off at the Freedom Tower stop. Often [not ever week] there is an exhibit in the building. Just go through the doors and ask the person inside. Tell them you are visiting the area. If there is something worth seeing they will let you know. If there is no one sitting at the desk just wander around.

Once inside, the selection of wines and the traditional Spanish decor will astound you. The food was excellent, as was the sangria. Service was very good and elegant.

"The Island Lady cruised us around Miami Bay so we could see the million dollar homes and condos. The cruise lasts for one hour & thirty minutes. There is a highly trained person narrating the sights in English & Spanish. The seats inside under cover or outside to soak in the sun are comfortable. The best place to stand is in the front ""bow"" of the boat. You get to see everything on both sides are easily. The 7:00 pm sailing allows you ample daylight to view homes, be able to view sunset over skyline of Miami plus you will see Miami skyline in lifts as it gets dark on your way back to port.

For dessert we shared the Pastel de Tres Leches, on a bed of caramel and cream. It was superb! We almost ordered another one because it was so, so good.

"Our first impression: Is this a bar? Where's the restaurant part? Our second impression was the randomness of the décor. It looks like they are aiming at being a fun waterfront restaurant with driftwood, surfboards, and bright beachy colors, but some of the other decorations just don't jibe -- for example: two fake pine trees with owls; non-matching knick-knacks and random potted plants at the entrance; very modern chrome hanging lights, dark floors, tables and chairs. Then there is the issue of the ""waterfront"". There is literally one table next to a window with a nice view of the water (which is across the street and a parking lot, by the way). We just couldn't help ""rearranging and redecorating"" this restaurants in our minds. But o.k., enough about ambiance. You go for the food. So, let's review the food. My husband raved about the Ahi burger. It was excellent, and a clever combination of ahi, coleslaw, and a pineapple slice. I had the Mushroom Sautee with Polenta Cakes and was sorely disappointed. The ""polenta cakes"" were three very thin slices of a store-bought polenta roll. At $10.99, they should have been real homemade polenta cakes, and larger than what I got. Anyway, we left with mixed feelings. Food: good and bad. Service: adequate. Ambiance: needs work.",05-May-16,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60921-d7361014-r370449165-H2O_Waterfront_Bistro-Port_Angeles_Clallam_County_Washington.html
"I've written a couple of reviews about the Waterstreet Café and Bar in the past and in the last two I said they needed to step it up. I'm glad to say that everything was excellent this time. The location and ambience is so nice, it's good to see that the service and the food excel as well. We went for an early dinner and had the Caesar salad, Mixed Greens salad, curry cauliflower sweet potato soup, and butternut squash ravioli. Everything was excellent. The warm bread served with dinner was delicious! Service was very professional and friendly. Refills were prompt, as was the clearing of the used dishes. Really, it was outstanding. We hope they keep up the good work. Congratulations, and thank you for a very pleasant dining experience!

"The atmosphere in this pub is great. It has that old-fashioned brick and woodwork look and the right vibe. The food was excellent and the Happy Hour prices so low that we ordered way too much food! The ""Small Nice Little Salad"" at $3 was anything but ""small"", and it was super. Everything tasted great. The three slider cheeseburgers were divine. Service (Thank you, Jess!) was prompt and friendly. For that informal cold beer and great tasty food, I highly recommend Crockett's. (And by the way, don't just have a cold beer, the mixed drinks being made looked delicious!)",16-Apr-16,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58693-d2290808-r364614344-Crockett_s_Public_House-Puyallup_Washington.html

"The food of today's Socialist Cuba (please don't confuse it with ""real"" Cuban Food), is bland, repetitive, and hardly satisfies. So it was a big pleasant surprise to get tasty good food, albeit tapas, at 3Js! The place is a bar/restaurant on the main street with a very pleasant atmosphere and energetic friendly staff.

"We had a family group dinner (9 adults) on a quiet week night. The waiter was pleasant and tried his best, but what came out of the kitchen missed the mark by a long shot! One of us had the Filet Mignon which was 1/3 inedible. It had so much gristle that it wouldn't even cut! The Seafood Louie, which was supposed to have crab, prawns and scallops, was delivered to the table entirely missing the crab and prawns. It came with only the scallops! One of us requested nothing on the Halibut Tacos, but it was served with everything on it, so it had to go back. The rest of the dinners were overcooked and unimpressive. We felt sorry for the waiter as he was trying his best, but the kitchen staff failed miserably. We've had disappointing meals at the Oyster House, but thought we'd give it another chance. Unfortunately, I think we'll stay away from now on. There are other waterfront restaurants in Olympia that are much better.",03-Feb-16,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d464218-r344759814-Olympia_Oyster_House-Olympia_Washington.html
"The Fish Tale Brew Pub is one of our favorite places for a beer and a bite to eat. But we must say we were sorely disappointed and surprised at the $50 price tag for two beers, a hamburger, a salad, and a cup of soup. Here's what got to us. The salad with grilled chicken was $15. It was on the small side and made with a lettuce mix from a bag (the same one we buy at Safeway). It was supposed to have sliced apples and nuts, but the apple slices were thin and very, very few. We didn't realize that the Pub Burger cost an additional $1.29 for cheese, and that the side of fries was another $1.50. That on top of the $13 for the burger. When the waitress took our order she asked if we wanted cheese and what side we wanted. It should be made clear to the customers that the sides and cheese are NOT included in the $13 price tag (which is way too high anyway).

However, the great ratings on Tripadvisor led us there. The décor is nautical and very relaxed. There is an outside deck and a beautiful view of Puget Sound. Our waiter, Wade, was beyond efficient and friendly. He went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. We noticed other staff being attentive and friendly to customers as well.

However, the place does not impress, and we were a bit hesitant when we entered. It is in dire need of a complete remodel which the owner told us is in the works. Having said that though, we sat at a table with a great close up look of the harbor. The room was cozy warm on a cold, rainy afternoon. Service was very friendly and we had a great talk with the owner. The food was fantastic and it was obvious that the chef took care and time in the preparation. The menu has burgers, sandwiches, seafood and some Caribbean dishes, which we hope they will keep and expand on as part of their renovation. We are glad that we happened upon this restaurant and will keep our eye on it as they remodel. We will be back, and next time we'll make sure to try the clam chowder. Give this small local restaurant a try. I think, like us, you'll be happy you did.",18-Dec-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58488-d927400-r333722093-Marketplace_Grille-Gig_Harbor_Washington.html
"Cool contemporary industrial décor gives this pub a very good ambiance. We had a pizza and veggie burger, along with beer, of course. Everything was very good. Service was friendly and excellent.

We had dinner recently at the Lacey location on Martin Way. The décor and atmosphere inside is very nice and comfortable. There is a small area with a warm fireplace to sit outside. Service was good. We ordered a couple of items from the Happy Hour menu which were at a very good price. The salad with black olives is always cold and fresh. The rolls they bring out are delicious. I had the squash ravioli which was very good. My husband had the pepperoni pizza and he didn't think it was that great. The meal presentation is simple -- no gourmet here. We thought for the price it was a very good meal. Parking can be a little tight in this location.,22-Nov-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d5106800-r328432064-Casa_Mia_of_Olympia_and_Lacey-Olympia_Washington.html
"We stopped at the Red Wagon Burgers for a quick lunch. The prices seemed a bit high for some items, for example, the wrap. It's a 'walk up and order at the counter' place. The hamburger was good and the fries are nice and crispy. Otherwise, it's just a regular burger joint. We also thought they should offer a grilled cheese sandwich in the Kids' Menu.

"The Yard House has an awesome view of the Orlando Eye (giant ferris wheel). The décor is modern and hip. However, it's dark and loud inside with many TVs on and music blasting. We sat outside to avoid the noise. The inside is huge; the outside section is much smaller. Service and friendliness was excellent. We had the Chicken Tortilla Soup, Pizza, and the California Roll. The soup was not the traditional tortilla soup. It was creamy and it was delicious. The Pizza was also very good. The California Roll, as the waitress explained when we ordered, is not the traditional sushi roll. It was crunchy rice and a lot of cucumber. We have to say it was not a hit with us. We prefer the traditional roll. Prices were very reasonable. There is a free parking garage very close by, and the 'park like' location is a very nice addition to Orlando.",07-Nov-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d6432735-r325043262-Yard_House-Orlando_Florida.html

Unfortunately we sat next to a screaming football fan, complete with loud swearing every time his team did something wrong. The Seafood Mac and Cheese sounded excellent on the menu, but it was terrible. It was not creamy. It was soupy with a mild bland taste. The bread it came with was wrinkled, soggy, and stale. We also tried the fish and chips, and had nothing grand to say about it either. The beer was expensive. Service was spotty. We definitely won't be back.

"The Columbia Restaurant was tops on everything: from the beautiful historic building, to the wait staff dressed in tuxedos -- everything was excellent. We were on the way back to Orlando from a day at the beach and wanted Cuban food, so Tripadvisor led us to The Columbia. We were afraid we would be underdressed, but saw that there were a variety of customers, from the after work types, to very dressed up, to tourists like us. Service was excellent and very attentive. They brought out warm bread that was to die for! I would return just for the bread. We had Tapas, drinks, and desserts and that was more than plenty. We sat in the bar and enjoyed live piano music.

"We were having an ""adult only"" day at the Magic Kingdom and wanted to eat in something other than an 'order and carry to your table' restaurant. We spotted Tony's right at the entrance and made reservations. It was a not so busy day at the park, however, the restaurant was almost all booked up. Luckily, we got a reservation halfway between lunch and dinner, so that was fine. We sat in the atrium area and as it happened, really enjoyed watching the parade go by as we ate. The service was excellent. The food was very good. The waiter brought bread and olive oil to the table and we enjoyed a tomato and mozzarella salad as a starter. We had the spaghetti and the chicken parmesan and it was very good and really hit the spot. This restaurant is a little expensive if you have kids with you, but for a retired couple on vacation it was just great. *Make reservations as soon as you enter the park.",03-Nov-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d478454-r324301788-Tony_s_Town_Square_Restaurant-Orlando_Florida.html
"We stopped for lunch between the kids' soccer games and found service very slow. We had the Mozzarella Sticks which were nothing exceptional. The pizzas and a hamburger were fine. The Baked Ziti was a disaster. It was neither baked, nor was it ziti pasta. It had cheese and sauce over very overcooked penne noodles. It went uneaten. We also ordered the Apple Bleu Cheese Salad which was severely lacking in bleu cheese crumbles. I couldn't taste the vinaigrette dressing, so I asked for some blue cheese dressing. The waiter said, ""that will be 40 cents"". WHAT? On a $9.99 salad??? Incredible. Service was slow and distracted.

"Our experience at Rafael's Restaurant was incredibly awful except for one exceptional waiter who outdid himself. We were guests of the hotel during a recent triathlon world championship. The hotel was full and very, very busy. We had been flying all day and were very hungry. All other restaurants nearby were packed. Rafael's Restaurant had a sign on their door that said they were closed for the next 30 minutes. However, it did not say 30 minutes from what time. When I asked the hostess if they were taking reservations, she said no. We waited and waited. Thirty minutes and more passed and still no sign of seating anyone. The restaurant had a number of empty tables visible to anyone coming to the door. Lots of hotel guests came by and were turned away. Luckily, a very nice waiter took pity on us, opened the door, and gave us a table. Apparently they had a large party in the back room and they were slammed. However, the restaurant knew about this reservation and apparently failed to staff appropriately. The atmosphere in the restaurant was beyond ridiculous. The hostess clearly did not know how to handle the situation. At one point, the hostess started waitressing and serving food, leaving the front desk unmanned. Staff was running around raising their eyes in frustration. Food was running out. The kitchen, which guests can see and hear from the tables, was a madhouse. There didn't seem to be anybody in charge. Our ""clean"" glasses on our table were so dirty, our waiter just took them and returned with cleaner ones. Our food finally arrived and it was unexceptional. Thank goodness for that one professional waiter. We hope next time management steps up and controls what turned out to be a circus. And the ""Closed for the next 30 minutes"" sign on the door -- it stayed up for the entire evening!",27-Sep-15,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d8666313-r314082501-Rafael_s_Restaurant-Chicago_Illinois.html
"This hotel is in need of a major overhaul. I stayed there for 3 nights to check out Chicago. My Two sons and I were going to the Texas verse Notre Dame game in South Bend  the beginning of Sept. I'm glad my wife was not with me because I would not have wanted her to stay in such a run down place, beds were old, furniture was old bathrooms were so outdated and nasty. There were places in our room where there was about a Two inch gap between the wall and the carpet. It's real nice when you walk in, we were thinking jackpot for location and cost, we got to the room via very tired elevators and it was very disappointing.

"Miller's Pub has that dark, crowded feel of an old-time bar. And it appeared, at least the evening we went, that it comes with old patrons as well. We couldn't help but notice that the bar was full of overweight men in their sixties. We wondered if it was a convention in town, football night, or what. The food was o.k., nothing exceptional. Service was efficient but not particularly friendly. The music playing was from the 1950s. The restaurant has a large beer selection. The place is noisy, busy, and the décor definitely old-time.",27-Sep-15,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d479668-r314102796-Miller_s_Pub_Restaurant-Chicago_Illinois.html

"We have eaten there several times in the past and liked the atmosphere, drinks, and food. This time though, we were disappointed in almost everything. The restaurant is typically very busy on weekend evenings, so we sat at a table at the bar. We ordered house salads. They were the smallest salads ever, and the blue cheese dressing was not very good. They were not worth $5. Then it took a really long time to get our pizza. The pizza was greasy and expensive. It's served in a huge rectangular tray that doesn't fit well on the tables so they are put on a folding stand. The many stands in the small bar area make it a maze if you want to use the restrooms. So, yes, dinner was disappointing. And to top it all off, my diet coke was flat.",26-Sep-15,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58549-d1049005-r313879295-The_Rock_Wood_Fired_Pizza-Lacey_Washington.html

"The décor and ambience at Bella Vita Ristorante is very nice and elegant. It's intimate and dark; a good place for a great Italian meal. The Caesar salad was very good, as was the bread that came with dinner. The Puttanesca was tasty, but a little salty. Service was very good until it came time to clear my plates and bring the check.

A couple of negatives about sitting on the deck was that one customer had a large dog nearby and it was chewing and banging a dog bone on the deck which was distracting. Another customer came out to smoke and stood about 5 feet away from us. Disgusting. Service was pleasant but a little bit slow. The food presentation was nice and we enjoyed our meal.

"We were looking for a good restaurant to take our 10 1/2 and 7 1/2 year old grandsons. One of the staff at Eagle Crest suggested Pappy's Pizzeria. It has a large play structure that the boys loved. The play area has an attendant which is very nice to keep little ones safe. The restaurant is very large and looks like a typical pizza parlor. There are rows and rows of tables which make this a perfect spot for large groups, parties, sports teams, etc. The pizza was ordinary, not excellent. We thought it could have used more sauce. The salad bar was also ordinary with the traditional salad bar items. The restaurant also has sandwiches, chicken, salads, and soup. In addition to the playarea, there is a game room. The play equipment was a bit worn, but for a family pizza meal, this place fits the bill.",01-Jul-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52033-d4463925-r284871157-Pappy_s_Pizzeria-Redmond_Central_Oregon_Oregon.html

Our waitperson was friendly, knowledgeable, and very efficient. We started with the fruit and cheeses platter and bottle of wine, had the Seafood Fettuccini and the Chicken Pepperoncini for dinner, and finished with the warmed brownie with ice cream and the crème brulee.

"We came in around 7:30 p.m. on a Monday evening. From the 15 minute wait to be seated (in an almost empty restaurant), to horrible food and service, things went from bad to worse! We had 7 people in our party. The Hostess went to look for a table and returned about 15 minutes later to seat us. Why we had to wait so long, we don't know, because the restaurant was almost empty. We were seated and got our drink orders and chips and salsas delivered. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. Finally we flagged a busboy down to get someone to take our order. I had the Street Tacos. At $9.99 from the Appetizer menu, they are a rip-off as they have about 50 cents worth of ingredients. The meat was dry, hard and tasteless. The tiny taco shells were not cooked. The kids had chicken tenders and rice. The chicken was terribly overcooked and charred. We joked that it was ""Blackened Chicken"". My adult son went to put some hot sauce on his dinner and the bottle stopper had been removed, so instead of being able to lightly pour some on his dinner, the whole contents of the bottle went on his plate. He told the waiter who shrugged, took the hot sauce bottle, and walked away. We had to pay for the ruined dinner. My husband ordered a Chicken Enchilada and got a Cheese Enchilada instead. Service was slow. Food was mediocre to awful. We should have gone to the Mayan Restaurant on Marvin instead!

"Dillinger's is very sophisticated. It's the site of a former bank. It's small and dark inside, but it's a very nice place for one of their signature drinks. We were enjoying an early June hot day, so we sat at one of the two small tables by the front door. It's a tight space, not very private, and you get the traffic going in and out of the restaurant, but that was o.k. We had a nice dinner, but we have some complaints: the descriptions on the menu don't match what you get. This is not acceptable in a nice restaurant. For example, I ordered the Blackened Pork and Polenta. There was nothing ""blackened"" about the pork. I also ordered the Wedge Salad. It was not a wedge by any stretch of the imagination. It was chopped pieces of lettuce shaped into a triangle. The other negative about the food is that my husband's salmon dish and my pork both had the same cheesy sauce (cheesy sauce on fish?!). The chef needs to check these inconsistencies out. This is a very nice restaurant, but those sorts of details need to be corrected. Other than that, service was pleasant and good. The drinks menu is extensive. Happy Hour drinks and food were a very good value.",06-Jun-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d6671846-r278289920-Dillinger_s_Cocktails_and_Kitchen-Olympia_Washington.html
"We are not from Tacoma and were visiting the collectibles toy store just a few doors down. It was lunchtime so we gave The Harvester a try. The restaurant looks like a regular neighborhood diner, so we didn't have grand expectations. We sat in a large booth by the open windows on a beautiful sunny day. The huge open windows are a nice touch. Service was friendly, very accommodating, and very good. But the arrival of the food was the pleasant surprise! The portions were gigantic!!! I had the Monte Cristo sandwich. It was probably 4 inches high, piled with ham and turkey. Equally generous was my daughter's Cobb salad and son's Club sandwich. The salads that came with the meals were fresh, crispy and equally large. The fries were nice and crispy. We had so much food, we took lots home which made for a quick dinner. I'm glad we tried this restaurant and we'll be back soon -- next time maybe for a late breakfast.",01-Jun-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58775-d4966797-r277100678-Harvester_Restaurant-Tacoma_Washington.html
"We had the chicken Rama and the chicken fried rice and were disappointed. Both dishes were very bland. Service was o.k., a little bit slow. The atmosphere is dark inside. We went on a beautiful warm day, but the outdoor area was not set up.

"We took advantage of the Happy Hour and had several items -- Texas Size Nachos, quesadilla, black beans queso with chips and salsa. We obviously ordered TOO much to eat! We had considered ordering the Romaine salad, but we're glad we didn't. A customer nearby had the salad and it was huge. Everything was great. Service was very good and quick even though they were packed. Drinks were great also. The atmosphere at this restaurant is elegant, busy, and fun.",26-May-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58775-d1069238-r274910337-The_Matador-Tacoma_Washington.html
"Location, location, location. If this dark, drab little place wasn't right by the locks, it would not entice customers like it does. Their sign proclaims ""World Famous Fish and Chips"" or something like that. So we tried the fish and chips -- nothing to write home about. The fries were not fresh and the seasoning on the fish nothing spectacular. The inside is dark, dusty, and crowded. The small bar section was even worse. The view was of the open smoking shed. Awful. Our server was overwhelmed after waiting on a table for 8. Service was poor. Don't be fooled by the sign and the location. There is another fish and chips restaurant within walking distance. Maybe try that one instead.",23-May-15,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d451178-r273998690-Lockspot_Cafe-Seattle_Washington.html
"This small Cuban restaurant is right next door to Anthony's HomePort on Shilshole Marina. We stopped by mid-afternoon for a beer and snack The restaurant is very small inside, but comfortable. There are some tables with umbrellas outside. We had the Tostones and tried the roast pork. Both were excellent. The restaurant serves Cuban sandwiches and entrees, plus Cuban coffees. Next time we're in the area we'll stop by for a Cortadito and piece of flan. The staff was very friendly and personable.

"Whenever we have visitors to Seattle, we take them to the Locks.  Here you can watch ships travel from fresh to salt water and vice versa.  The actual lowering and raising of the water in the locks and the team work of the workers is a wonderful sight to see.  However, the best part of the visit is to see the salmon ladder.  These majestic fish are on their way to spawn in rivers and creeks around Lake Wshington and they can viewed through special windows.",23-May-15,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d319153-r274001954-Hiram_M_Chittenden_Locks-Seattle_Washington.html
"This was our first time at this restaurant. We were looking for a place to have an early dinner, there was an empty parking spot right in front, so we decided to go for it. The décor is comfortable, cozy and elegant. We specially liked the rows of windows with comfortable cushion and pillows. There is a nice small outdoor area and a small bar space inside. It was mid-week and relatively early for dinner, so the restaurant was empty except for another table with two people. We ordered wine and the server, who was doing hosting, busing, serving, and apparently, bartending as well, took a really long time to bring it over. He seemed to be training a new employee while we sat there waiting. We started with the house made foccocia. It was very good. For dinner, we had the rigatoni with marinara and the spaghetti casio e pepe. The rigatoni was very good but not outstanding. The spaghetti was o.k. but was very unappetizing looking. The cheese on top of the dishes was shaved too thin. We would have preferred thicker slices. For dessert, we had a very good creamy dish with rhubarb. Again, very good, but not excellent. Good dinner, but not memorable.",14-May-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d3826404-r271980020-Agrodolce-Seattle_Washington.html
"Don Juan's Mexican Kitchen is on a corner of a parking lot. Even though the location has no views and is not in a fancy spot, I can't give this restaurant anything less than 5 stars! The food is the best Mexican food in the area; no doubt about it. We went between lunch and dinner and sat outside to enjoy the gorgeous warm day. The servers were friendly and informative. Out came a large basket of house-made tortilla chips. They were thicker than store-bought chips and much, much better. The server also brought out a variety of house-made salsas and explained each. For the meal, I had the street tacos with carnitas. Everything was very, very good, from the beans, to the rice, to the slow-cooked pork in the tacos. My husband, who always orders Chile Rellenos in Mexican restaurants, declared this to be the best ever! To be clear, this is not a restaurant where you are going to order a big platter combination covered in sauce and cheese. We finished our meal with absolutely the best flan we have ever had (and we're Hispanic, so we are very familiar with flan). We heard and read other reviews about how busy this restaurant gets, which is understandable. If you can, go at an in-between time like we did. Service was excellent and we didn't have to wait for a table. We'll definitely make the drive from Olympia again to enjoy this gem!",08-May-15,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58779-d3625828-r270841352-Don_Juan_s_Mexican_KItchen-Tenino_Washington.html
"This was our first time at Peppers at this location. First impressions of the restaurant are that it's nicely decorated with a Mexican theme and it's larger than it looks from outside. We went after the Procession of the Species and the restaurant was very busy, but there was no waiting. Our waitress was awful. She was unfriendly and hurried. We had to request water, refills on chips, and after waiting and waiting, I finally got up, walked into the bar, and asked for a refill on my soda. At one point, we asked for a wet towel to wipe spilled salsa on out table and the waitress threw several napkins on the table and walked away without saying a word. The food was o.k., not outstanding. I would have liked to order sour cream to improve the rice and black beans burrito, but the waitress never came around to ask how things were. Granted, we understand how a busy evening can be stressful, but this is a perfect example of how a bad waitperson can influence the dining experience negatively. We probably won't be back.",27-Apr-15,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d1517016-r268326583-Peppers_Mexican_Restaurant-Olympia_Washington.html
"Pomodoro is in the quaint Proctor district of Tacoma. It has the feel of a friendly local restaurant where one could easily become a regular. The decor is very nice, and the cooking odors delicious! We went on a Sunday early evening and were greeted immediately and seated right away. We had the Smoked Salmon Penne and the Prawns with Fettuccini. The entrees came with a choice of soup or salad. Portions on both the salads and the dinners were large. Everything was delicious and prices are very reasonable! The restaurant uses a lot of garlic, so you better like garlic because both entrees and salads had heavy garlic flavor! Service was friendly and attentive. We were very happy with everything but have a couple of small complaints: the bread which came with dinner was neither warm nor fresh; and the restaurant uses paper napkins which isn't very elegant. Otherwise, all great.",20-Apr-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58775-d464107-r266931870-Pomodoro-Tacoma_Washington.html

"This was our first time there. The restaurant doesn't impressed from the outside. It's off busy Harrison Ave on Olympia's west side, set amongst strip mall establishments. We stopped for dinner early on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was pretty empty and quiet. First impressions of the décor: very good -- cozy, close-by tables and booths, dark wood details, and a look reminiscent of an nice established restaurant. (The only décor suggestions we would have is to get rid of the grandma lace curtains). Service was very friendly and quick. The food was delicious. We had the Coconut Curry and the Drunken Sailor, both excellent. Prices were on the higher end. For the price, it would have been nice to have had a bread basket and/or small salad come with the meal. We tried the Bitter Rabbit beer and it also was good. We peeked in the bar and it looked like a nice small place to stop for a beer and food. It's out of the way for us but we'll be back.",14-Apr-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d805111-r265691111-The_Iron_Rabbit_Restaurant_and_Bar-Olympia_Washington.html
"From the outside, this coffee shop appears small. Step inside though and be surprised. The décor and vibe are great. It's friendly, fast-paced, and everything delicious. They were very busy, but service was fast, attentive, and there was plenty of seating inside and out. They sell coffees, pastries, breakfast, burgers, beer, etc. We shared the Havana Panini. It was similar to a sandwich Cubano, but spicy. It was very good. We also had the lemon brioche. Delicious as well! And great coffee. We'll be back next time we're in the area.",29-Mar-15,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58557-d666597-r262470484-Useless_Bay_Coffee_Company-Langley_Whidbey_Island_Washington.html
"Toby's has that old-timers' tavern look and feel. Bar with stools, booths along the perimeters, and an old pool table in the middle. We stopped for a cold beer in the afternoon.

"We specifically wanted to have dinner at the Oyster and Thistle based on the raves from Tripadvisor. We didn't have reservations, and the dining room was full, so we took a booth in the small bar. The bartender was very busy filling large drink orders, so we sat unacknowledged for about 10 - 15 minutes. The bartender then took our order for drinks and another 15 minutes or so passed. When we asked where our drinks were, he had forgotten all about our order! For dinner we shared a Caesar salad and had the Puttanesca and Pub Burger. The food was unexceptional and lacking in flavor. We had to request salt and Ketchup. Since the bartender was doing double duty as our server, we were pretty much ignored the rest of the time. A special occasion at a recommended restaurant was ruined by crappy service. We won't be back.",29-Mar-15,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58545-d6547335-r262522932-The_Oyster_Thistle_Restaurant_and_Pub-La_Conner_Washington.html

The atmosphere is very nice and cozy. There is outdoor seating with a view. Service was very prompt and pleasant. The only drawback I can see is that you have to go up a big steep staircase to reach the restaurant. It didn't look like there was an elevator available. The regular menu was large and everything sounded very appetizing. We'll be back for dinner.",23-Mar-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58766-d2659038-r261364845-Topside_Bar_and_Grill-Steilacoom_Washington.html
"We hadn't been back to the Waterstreet Café for several years due to a negative experience (tab too high for what we got in food and service). However, this time things were much better. Last time there was no Hostess present and we had to wait until the Host finished filling water glasses, etc. to be seated. This time, we were acknowledged right away. The restaurant's atmosphere is elegant and the wall which was removed to expose the kitchen and let more light in is a big improvement. I had the Fried Polenta which was very good but would have been better with something else instead of the toasted kale - spinach maybe? My husband had the halibut and it was excellent. Service was good, but we had to request bread which was irritating. This is one of the ""fanciest"" restaurants in Olympia. They really need to step it up and act like it. Customers should get ice water, bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and excellent service each and every time. Diners should be offered dessert and coffee at the end of their meal. There is an outdoor area for nice for warm days, but it could use a good facelift. The location and vibe of this place is good, it just needs some small improvements to make it great.",23-Mar-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d1382924-r261367855-Waterstreet_Cafe_and_Bar-Olympia_Washington.html
"Tucked into a little side street off Lake City Way, Mojito is easy to miss. It's a colorful, small building with just the right informal Latin America look. We had the Lechon Asado and Pescado Mojito. The marinated pork was excellent, as was the fish. Service was friendly and very good. The seating inside is cozy and comfortable, and there is outside seating for nice days. If you hunger for Caribbean and Latin America food and drinks, stop there and enjoy.

We went for dinner on the recommendation of my brother and his wife who recently moved to Black Lake and found this treasure. The inside décor is impressive and I think, the best Japanese-styled restaurant in Olympia. Service was efficient and very pleasant. We had several sushi rolls and a Bento Box, green tea and beer. The sushi was very good and there was plenty of food. If you love sushi this is a great restaurant to go with friends. It has a comfortable authentic feel.

We enjoyed every part of this adventure! The gondola ride is smooth and modern with a breathtaking view of the Howe Sound! The resturant and gift shop has a lovely woodsy feel that fits perfectly into its environment .  The pathways are wide and safe with a comfortable rate of incline for all ages and abilities. From stroller to wheelchair all will enjoy this adventure! Beautifully sensitive to the environments wit minimal disruption.

"Here's our experience: We arrived at the steps to be greeted by a Hostess (curly hair, young woman). We asked if there was seating inside and she just stared at us, turned around, and went inside. The stranger behind us, also waiting, said, ""I hope we don't get the same response"". She sat us outside, and we couldn't help but watch as she inefficiently left her station each and every time a new group came to be seated. She walked off for several minutes to go check for tables each and every time (don't they have a seating chart?). We saw lots of people get frustrated and leave. So on to the food: We had the chicken pot pie and the macaroni and cheese. Both were single servings (small) but the prices were outrageous! The tiny, several bites chicken pot pie was $18! Even half of that would have seemed high. Then service: One waitress took our order; another person delivered our food; and we never saw our waitress again. She didn't check on us, get us refills of the drinks, or anything. We finally had to flag down another server to get our bill. Disappointing and annoying time. And, by the way, the food was not that good.",22-Feb-15,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g154948-d6929487-r255880783-Beacon_Pub_Eatery-Whistler_British_Columbia.html
"We were looking forward to going to The Mexican Corner based on the Trip Advisor reviews. The restaurant is up a big flight of stairs above the Beaver Tails kiosk. The space is fairly small, crowded, and loud. However, the art on the walls is amazing. We arrived and were told there was a 1 hour wait and to go next door for drinks as there is no space for people to wait. The restaurant has a tiny bar with 6 seats, so waiting at the bar was not an option. We walked next door and within 10 minutes we got a text indicating our table was ready (we had to down our drinks quickly which was a waste!). The food is authentic Mexican with a gourmet bent. This is not the typical Mexican restaurant with the never empty basket of chips and salsa, and the large platters of cheese covered food. I had the fish tacos, black refried beans, and a mango margarita. My husband had the pulled chicken quesadilla. We weren't wowed by the taste of the food. The chicken had a burnt/smoky taste. The mango margarita wasn't that good, the refried beans lacked salt, and there was nothing really tasty in the fish tacos. This place is expensive for Mexican food. Service was good. But based on the food which we weren't thrilled about, we will not be back.",19-Feb-15,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g154948-d3340277-r255295611-The_Mexican_Corner_Restaurant-Whistler_British_Columbia.html

So instead, we tried our luck, walked in and they sat us right away at 5:30pm. So, we're not sure what the ""reservations"" issue was. The restaurant wasn't full and there was no waiting list.

The décor is great and very well done - interesting collection of power house items tastefully incorporated into an upscale look. The beer selection is pretty good. We had the French Dip with fries, and the fish tacos. Both were excellent. The only negative comment we have is that the wait for the food seemed long, and the waitress was not particularly welcoming or friendly.

"We went to Little Jerry's for breakfast based on the excellent reviews by others. We were not impressed. The restaurant is small, long and narrow. There is Seinfeld memorabilia on the walls; the menu items are named for episodes; and the TV is on Seinfeld re-runs. Service was slow. The waitress was on her phone texting or visiting with a customer/friend for a lot of the time. It took a while to get our food. We and another customer nearby had to ask for water; he for coffee. And speaking of the coffee - it was awful. We asked the waitress what it was and she said Folgers. Why in heaven's name would a NW restaurant serve Folgers??? It was brewed strong and undrinkable. When our food finally arrived, it was lukewarm.

"This was our first visit to the Cooper Point Public House. First impressions - bad décor. The booths are cheap stained plywood and the other seats look like they were acquired second-hand. The bar is small and equally without character and there aren't many beers on tap compared to other local pubs. However, having said that, the food was fantastic! We loved everything we ordered: goat cheese and spinach dip in a sourdough bread bowl, chicken Caesar salad, fish and chips, and cold beer. Service was pretty good and the waitress was friendly. There was a bit of confusion with the menus. We got two with different prices. When we pointed it out to the waitress she said one was an old one. Also, the beer list on the menu was not current. We had a coupon from Restaurant.com and that is the reason we went there to eat. However, the waitress said she couldn't accept it because we had ordered from the Happy Hour menu, rather than the regular priced menu. The coupon did not indicate anything about that, so that was disappointing. It just said you had to spend $20 which we did. We'll be back for the food, but we hope the owners think about redecorating and making their pub a bit nicer.",17-Jan-15,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d6609500-r249733893-Cooper_Point_Public_House-Olympia_Washington.html
"I have stayed here at the La Quinta a total of 3 times and I will never be back again.  My first two stays were not bad.  Clean rooms, cold pool.  This time we stayed 01/01/2015-01/03/2015.  We came over to visit our grandson and actually brought him back with us to stay in the room.  Upon checking in to our room, we noticed that the door to our room was open, there were housekeepers in the next room and they could here us talking, they advised us that the room had been clean but that they were waiting to deliver towels to our room and we probably shouldn't have been checked in.  We checked in at about 3:30 or so.  My husband was playing on the floor of this ""newly"" cleaned room when he noticed there were empty cans of beer under the bed which he just picked up and put into the garbage.  Okay, I guess we can overlook this.  Next day we come back from town and turn on the television, the television worked for a short time and than we were unable to get any service, I contacted the front desk and the young man at the front desk came to our room and explained that the housekeepers clean the room so good that they move the television stand and so cords could have come unconnected.  I chuckled because when we came back from town, the bed had been made, the room not vacuumed and there was a piece of plastic next to the garbage that we once placed in the garbage the previous day.  The young man left and a few minutes later the television died, I contacted the front desk and he advised me to jiggle the wires.  We jiggled the wires and nothing happened, I asked if there was a cable outage, the young man at the front desk said no but we could move rooms.  So I packed up everything and moved our rooms, the television worked in the room for a short time and then it also died.  My husband went up to the front desk and the young man advised us that cable in Wenatchee was out and they were working on it.  Needless to say, I was very upset because we had to move rooms when they should have checked on the cable problem first before moving our rooms.

The buffet is poor compared to similar pizza buffets. Not a lot of choices and so-so food. Some of the serving dishes were empty and did not refilled. This is just a basic place to eat.

We stopped to grab a bite during Happy Hour. The restaurant is nice and large. The Happy Hour menu has $1 items with the purchase of a drink - even a soda. Service was not good though. We sat at a booth that had the last patron's payment on it the entire time we were there. It was never picked up. Chips and salsa arrived right away but our food took a while. We also were never offered extra chips even though our basket was empty. Our waitress just didn't seem to be particularly friendly or prompt.,08-Dec-14,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58693-d5014761-r243520259-El_Toro_Mexican_Restaurant-Puyallup_Washington.html
"Bahama Breeze's restaurant and bar architecture and décor is reminiscent of Key West, FL. The staff is very welcoming and friendly - from opening the door for customers to being professional and prompt. We ate in the bar where it was cozy warm from the outdoor heaters. There was live music playing - very pleasant. The menu has many Cuban specialties, and well as other Caribbean and Latin America dishes. We had a side of Tostones, a bowl of black bean soup, the rice and fish dish, and finished up with a huge slice of key lime pie. All was delicious. Relaxing, delicious food and drinks, great staff - what's not to like?",24-Nov-14,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58791-d432525-r241282461-Bahama_Breeze-Tukwila_Washington.html
"We stopped for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The Holiday Bazaar was going on nearby and church was probably just getting out, so we there were several groups waiting for tables in the tiny entry. We had about a 15 minute wait. Breakfast was great and portions huge. Service was very good even though they were very busy. The kids were amused at the décor and with all the real rusty tractors outside. This is a great place to stop on the way to the beach. Good home style cooking and small-town attitude. We'll stop by again.",24-Nov-14,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58457-d511042-r241283665-Rusty_Tractor-Elma_Washington.html
"We stopped for lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant and bar were relatively busy. Service was very bad. We sat and sat and nobody greeted us or came by. We noticed there didn't seem to be too many wait staff. When the young woman finally came, there was little warmth or charm to her demeanor. The place is big and the décor is very nice. It has some church-like windows, and stained glass. There are a lot of flat screen TVs. We sat in the bar area near the shuffleboard tables which were being played by kids. They were not carrying on a real shuffleboard game, just playing with the equipment. They were noisy and just goofing around, so that was distracting. After the waitress finally showed up and took our order, the food came out surprisingly fast. I had the tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich and both were delicious! My husband had the burger and he said it was good - nothing outstanding. The burger with no fries was $8 which seems a little high. I would return for the food. But I hope management encourages staff to be more upbeat and friendly - and puts a stop to kids running around playing with the shuffleboard equipment.",23-Nov-14,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58349-d7200341-r241182538-Tavern_Hall-Bellevue_Washington.html
"We stopped by during Happy Hour on a Saturday. We preferred to sit in the lounge. However, it was all reserved which surprised us because usually one is not able to reserve space in a bar. So, o.k. we sat in a booth in the dining room. Service was professional and attentive. The Happy Hour menu is not real inexpensive, but one can eat dinner portions for a pretty good price. The food was all very good with the exception of the Pulled Pork Tacos. The pork was a bit dry. We told the waitress, but that's as far as that went as far as we know. We had Fried Oysters, Andouille Mac, Crab Wontons, Fried Rockfish Sandwich, etc. It was all very good.

"Just like everyone else in town, we stopped by the new brew pub in downtown Olympia to check it out. It was packed but we managed to snag a few stools and sit down for a beer. The décor is modern industrial - very nice. We didn't try the food. We will next time. There are two separate areas. The one with the bar has long tables and stools. The other area has tables. It was super noisy in there and it didn't help that the bartender shouts out people's names so they can pick up their beer (We seriously hope they stop that as it is jarring and interrupts any conversation one is having!). It looks like outdoor seating will be available in the future, which will be nice. The beer on tap selection was good - theirs own plus some guest taps.

"We went for dinner with four adults and two kids. First impression is that the Spar is an awesome place, but not necessarily great for family dinners. The largest table they had for our group of 6 was right next to the pool table in the back. The atmosphere is more of a bar than a restaurant. It's very dark in there. They have a kids' menu and the food was all very good. We had pizzas, fish and chips, and turkey sandwich. The kids had hot dogs and fries. The service, on a busy Friday evening, was very slow. We had to flag down our server to order, get more water, and to get our bill.",15-Nov-14,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d451232-r239936372-McMenamins_Spar_Cafe-Olympia_Washington.html
"This review is for the Happy Hour. We had the $6 Ahi Nachos and it was beyond ridiculous. It was a dinner plate with literally 4 tortilla chips. Four! Sure, they had chopped ahi on top, but we were expecting nachos to share. There was nothing else - no tomatoes, avocados, cheese. Nothing. The $5 Happy Hour burger came with lettuce, tomatoes, pickes, onions, and fries, so that was better. But they need to do better on the nachos. Come on, at least give us more chips.

"After visiting the pumpkin farm in the Nisqually Valley, it was time for dinner, so we stopped at Norma's. The restaurant is an old-fashioned diner with menu to match. There are burgers, sandwiches, fries, etc. There is a children's menu with 4 items. The children's items ranged from $5.99 to $7.99 - kind of expensive for a kid's meal. They have many milkshake flavors. We tried the blackberry milkshake and it was o.k., not excellent. The kids had the Oreo milkshakes and they did not like them. Service was o.k.; music from the 1950s and 1960s. It was o.k., wouldn't highly recommend.",14-Oct-14,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d1191799-r234334574-Norma_s_Burger-Olympia_Washington.html

After our meal, the waiter brought us a complimentary fried Oreo cookie dessert to try, which was also very good. All was excellent.

"Salty's is a true ""little beach-front restaurant"", from the décor to the ambience. It sits right at the water's edge at Redondo Beach. There is free parking out front. We went during Happy Hour and were disappointed in the choices of beer (2) and the prices. Plus the Happy Hour appetizers weren't that enticing either. Our waitress was attentive and personable. She described the evening's chef's special, which was not on the menu. It sounded very good: Mahi-mahi on a bed of rice made with coconut milk, mango sauce, etc. We ordered the special plus the $8 Happy Hour Fish and Chips, and the small Caesar salads. The Fish (2 pieces) and Chips were good; the fries excellent. The Caesar salads were equally good; very tasty dressing. The mahi-mahi however was a different story. For $29 we were expecting a nice big piece of mahi-mahi. Instead it was a ""filet"" about 1/4 inch thick. The sweet-sounding bed of rice turned out to be what we suspiciously think was dirty rice under a cover of mango chutney. The serving was small and frankly, at $29, a serious rip-off. Total bill with tip, just under $100. Ouch!",07-Oct-14,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58439-d463557-r233107636-Salty_s_at_Redondo_Beach-Des_Moines_Washington.html

"The Old School Pizzeria is a downtown casual 'walk up, place your order, and pick it up at the end of the counter when they call your name' place. The Friday evening we went, there was a constant line of the tattooed and pierced youth of downtown Olympia lined up to order. You can get pizza by the slice or a whole pizza and calzones. The salad choices were limited. They sell wine, beer, soda pop, tea, and juice. The atmosphere is ""shabby hippie"" with old posters covering the walls. The floor was visibly dirty causing us to wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen.... The pepperoni pizza was o.k. The dinner salad was pretty good.

From the outside it doesn't look like much, but once you enter you see the Caribbean colors, wooden tables, large murals and paintings, and it's all good. The food was excellent. We had the ham croquetas and the Medianoche sandwich served with fries. All was very tasty and very authentically Cuban. The staff was pleasant, and service was great. The menu is relatively small since this restaurant is mostly open for lunch Monday through Friday; however, they have just added Happy Hour specials on Thursdays and Fridays 3:00 - 7:00 p.m. We will definitely be back for Mojitos, Empanadas, Tostones, yuca frita, black beans and rice, and Cuban Sandwiches!

"This restaurant is worthy of a visit just to enjoy the gorgeous views of the Seattle skyline. What an excellent place to take out-of-town guests! We ate dinner there on a beautiful late summer day. We sat outside and it was very comfortable. They had heaters there, so it was very cozy. Our waitress did everything possible to make our dining experience great. She was personable and very pleasant. (Thank you, Liya!) She asked if we had been there before (we hadn't) so she explained the menu and recommended some dishes. We had the sushi, dirty rice, and the fish kebob. Everything was marvelous. The servings are huge, so we had leftovers for home. There is complimentary valet parking. The whole restaurant has a great, comfortable vibe. It's the kind of place where you can come in wearing shorts or a formal before the prom. Dinner was pricy, but everything is great, so it's worth it if you want a great meal.

"The food at the Plaza Jalisco Mexican restaurant in Morton was o.k. It is the typical Mexican restaurant food. I ordered the Tostada which looked exactly like a Taco Salad. The waiter was not able to tell us what the difference was. My daughter had her favorite dish, from the Plaza Jalisco located in Tumwater, WA, the Pollo Loco. It's a huge plate of food and tortillas to create your own tacos. We didn't think the restaurant's atmosphere was very good. The booths and tables' set up is very awkward. The building is long and narrow and the tables and booths are in long rows. There are tables for two by the open kitchen area which puts them right in the middle of all the foot traffic. We weren't impressed with our server either. Service was slow and disjointed. We got two of our dinners well before they brought out the third person's meal. We had to ask for more chips and salsa and a refill on the soda. This restaurant has a couple of things going for it: It's right by the busy highway so it gets a lot of customers that way, and we didn't see much else in Morton. So, if you're hungry, this might be it. Otherwise, I'd say, skip it.",02-Sep-14,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58619-d3571268-r226514517-Plaza_Jalisco_Mexican_Restaurant-Morton_Washington.html

"Our first impression was not so good. We had a party of 9 - five adults and four kids. The kids were very hungry and we asked if there were crackers or something quick they could snack on, but were told no. We ended up going next door to Subway for apple slices for them. We got paper plates and plastic forks which caused us to raise our eyebrows. In their defense, they did later explain that their dishwasher was broken. There is no kids' menu, but you can order an 8"" pizza for them for $8, but that's a bit much for a kid's meal. Service was disorganized. We had to repeatedly ask for forgotten things: straws, drinks, sugar for the tea, etc. One person delivered an item to our table while speaking on a cell phone! The prices for salads was high, the pizza crust was burnt, and the sauce was salty.

We don't have the Golden Corral where we live, so they begged us to go back. It seemed better this time. Last time, the only good thing was the bread. This time we liked the turkey, yams, and meatloaf. The kids go crazy for the dessert bar, specially the cotton candy and chocolate fountain. The customers act like they are in a real live pig corral, and many don't supervise their kids. The staff is hurried and not entirely customer friendly -- but, given the atmosphere of crazed eating, food waste, and hordes of tired, hungry people, plus low wages and probably no tips, who can blame them? A bit high priced for a buffet restaurant. Drinks are not included.",22-Jul-14,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d644933-r216870749-Golden_Corral-Orlando_Florida.html

"Rotelli has a large menu and nice décor. The prices are very reasonable. The pizzas were good and two types of bread rolls were brought to our table with our dinners. However, service was slow and the waitress not particularly friendly or helpful. We had coupons that we had picked up at the resort and when we tried to use them she said they were only for take-out. We read further and found one on the same brochure for dining in. She failed to point that out. She also sat our party of 6 in a small round table and when our pizzas came, insisted on putting them on the table even though we wouldn't have had room to eat. The restaurant was fairly empty and we asked her to put them on the table next to us, but apparently she had problems accepting that idea. So other than the service issue, which was not a big deal but is always unpleasant, the food and prices were very good. And note to owners: the child menu should have a small pizza.",22-Jul-14,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34571-d873482-r216956289-Rotelli-Pompano_Beach_Broward_County_Florida.html

"This restaurant is tucked in a side strip mall. It doesn't look like much from the outside. The inside, however, was a surprise. The island décor is appropriate and the restaurant feels inviting.

"This small local restaurant in downtown Olympia is open for breakfast and lunch. They have a huge menu with fresh, organic and interesting ingredients. They make their own dressings, soups, hashbrowns, and jams. There are lots of sides to choose from, plus they have a Children's Menu. The décor is funky as are many of the customers. We went for lunch and had delicious sandwiches. Next time we'll do breakfast!",03-Jun-14,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d464219-r208719734-New_Moon_Cafe-Olympia_Washington.html
"We hate to rain on the other reviewers' parade, but we were very disappointed! My husband ordered the blackberry soft serve cone. When he tasted it, he said it tasted nothing like blackberries. It tasted like mocha! I told him we should return it, but by then we were half way down the block. The vanilla soft serve is mixed to order with flavors. We're not sure if the guy picked up the wrong flavor or what. Anyway, it was not rich and creamy either. We were also not impressed (at all) with the service. The older man at the counter took our order. Then he passed it on to a young man who took about 15 minutes to get us the cone. The place was not busy at all, so this young man needs lessons in time management. While we waited, he took the time to refill the cones next to the machine (Dude, do that AFTER you serve your waiting customers!). It was too bad we had such an experience because downtown Olympia can use a good ice cream store. They also sell milkshakes, Italian sodas, candy, and chocolates. Prices were reasonable, even though my husband mentioned that the .99 cent cones at McDonalds are better and so are the Wendy's Frosty. We're willing to give it one more try because we really would like to see them succeed. So, we'll be back sometime this summer.",30-May-14,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d4823051-r208119253-Grandpa_s_Soda_Fountain_and_Ice_Cream_Parlor-Olympia_Washington.html
"We're from out of town and were wandering around looking for a place for lunch. The Olde Creekside Cafe's outside seating with Hawaiian-looking umbrellas drew us in on a beautiful sunny day in May, and we were very glad they did. Service was excellent and very accommodating. There were many substitutions, suggestions, and sides offered. We had the chicken and rice wrap with a side of spicy peanut sauce. The food was delicious, the presentation was elegant, and everything was great! The coffee was unexpectedly good - comparable to Starbucks. We sat outside, so I can't comment on inside décor. Would definitely recommend for lunch. And one last thought: We both wondered about the name since the location doesn't seem to be by a creek (?).",25-May-14,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58569-d2697014-r206965756-Olde_Creekside_Cafe-Longview_Washington.html
"Jimmy John's is new to the Olympia area, so we thought we'd give it a try. It has a fast-food restaurant look with order counter and booths, plus drive-thru. It's not very big inside. There is outside seating facing busy Martin Way. Staff was friendly and tried to be helpful. The sandwiches were o.k. The bread tasted better than Subway's. Their claim to fame is speed filling your order and delivery. Here are our first-impressions though: There is no nutritional / calorie information at the restaurant. When we asked, we were told it is online (which I checked, and yes, it is). However, that didn't help when I'm at the restaurant ready to order. The staff did suggest a lower-calorie lettuce wrap. There doesn't seem to be a children's menu which I find to be a big negative. And third, we didn't get asked / encouraged to add extras or modify our sandwich. As it was, I had the Veggie and it was dry and not very exciting so I had them add more vinaigrette. My husband had the Gargantuan which he said was almost like a Jake (Dirty Dave's on Martin Way), but nowhere as good. Prices were pretty similar to a sit down restaurant, so unless we're hungry and in a big hurry, we won't be back.",17-May-14,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58549-d6498466-r205929959-Jimmy_John_s-Lacey_Washington.html
"This small side street pub in Hoquiam was recommended to us. As we headed east from Ocean Shores towards home, we stopped there on an early Sunday evening to grab a beer and dinner. The pub is small and very dark. It has ample parking and two outside tables. We had just sat down and were reading the menu when two customers sitting at opposite ends of the bar from each other began a loud and heated political argument. Soon, two others joined in. Unfortunately, the argument didn't have any signs of quieting down, so we quickly paid for our drinks and left. Too bad because the menu had some interesting items.",05-May-14,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58519-d2304901-r204142087-8th_Street_Ale_House-Hoquiam_Washington.html
"Ocean Beach Roasters décor and ambience is great. You walk in, are greeted and see delicious baked goods on display. There are plenty of tables by the windows and in the upstairs loft. We stopped in twice. The first time we did the wine tasting. All was good with the exception of the staff pouring himself a taste and drinking it with us. (We have never seen that before). The next morning we came in for coffees and baked goods. The baked goods did not disappoint, however the coffee sure did. It wasn't being made properly and it was very weak. Being Starbucks coffee drinkers, and having worked years at a coffee roasters, one person in our group talked to the staff about it and offered (friendly) suggestions on making espresso. The reaction to this was mixed: the young man said to give the young woman a break since it was her first day. There was resistance to the comments yet they made new coffees for two people in our group (there were 6 of us). He thanked us for the comments on the way out, but really should have made us all new coffees or given us a coupon for next time we came in. That's just common sense customer service. One last note: we had a variety of the baked goods, but the other customers' soups and sandwiches looked delicious. Owners: Train new employees on the art of making espresso and we'll be back.",05-May-14,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58648-d4754822-r204146359-Ocean_Beach_Roasters_Bistro-Ocean_Shores_Washington.html

"La Isla was busy, but not full on a beautiful Sunday early evening. They have several tables outside, as well as a sunny counter with stools to have a drink and a snack. We sat inside at a table by the window. First impression: dirty window sill with small chunks of food on it! Gross. The Happy Hour menu had a small piece of food stuck to it and there were food crumbs on the floor. Yuck! Service was very slow. It took forever to get our drink order: a beer and coke. And my husband ordered a second beer with his dinner and it arrived during dessert. We noticed that the table next to ours got 1 mojito and waited literally half an hour for the other person's mojito to arrive. The customer said, ""I hope this is half price since I had to wait so long for it"". The clueless waiter said, ""No, that's only available late at night"". What he should have said is, ""It's on the house!"". The food was o.k. The tostones and pork were good. The tres leches dessert was very good and the portion, served with whipping cream and ice cream, was huge. Ambiance (very loud in there) and décor, so-so. We won't be returning.",14-Apr-14,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d795590-r201063645-La_Isla-Seattle_Washington.html
"This seemingly small place (it's not, it just looks small from the outside) was crazy busy on an early Friday night of spring break. It was packed with large family groups with lots of kids. The décor is an eclectic mixture of license plates, antique logging saws, carved bears, etc. Parents were letting their kids walk around the restaurant, the place was packed and loud, and the waitresses were literally running. Our impression was: If you want a nice, quiet meal, this is NOT the place to go. The food was pretty good. Salads were large and nice and fresh. Service was slow because they were busy, but very accommodating and friendly. However, we had 7 people in our group, including several very hungry children, and our food was not all delivered at the same time. So some of us were eating while the others waited hungrily. We ordered fresh uncooked tomatoes on the pizza and they came cooked. We asked the waitress if we could get a few slices of tomatoes and she said the cook was too busy. The restaurant has a walk-up order counter which added to the chaos and the slower service. There is a smallish and unattractive bar in the back with an uninviting outdoor area, so this would not be a place I would recommend for a drink. We go to Ocean Shores about once or twice a year, so I think next time we'll try someplace else.",12-Apr-14,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58648-d3256422-r200848002-Red_Genie_Pizza-Ocean_Shores_Washington.html
"This ice cream parlor is part of the Playtime Family Fun amusement park (go-kart track, etc.). They had a lot of ice cream flavors. Scoops were large and we were glad we limited out kids' cones to 1 scoop, since they were huge. Prices are not too bad for an ice cream shop, but plan to spend $3+ for each cone. They also serve espresso, smoothies, Italian sodas, etc. They are open until 11:00 p.m. which was a nice treat after going to the cinema. The only improvement we suggest is that they add more tables and chairs. On a late Friday evening during spring break, our group of 7 had to share a table for 4.",12-Apr-14,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58648-d5212067-r200849701-Peppermint_Parlor-Ocean_Shores_Washington.html
"We stopped by for a cold beer today at the brand new Top Rung Brewery. Thumbs up!!! They had three beers: IPA, Blonde Ale, and Stout. The décor is industrial; very sleek. It has very high ceilings, and large wood tables to hold big groups, as well as bistro tables for more intimate seating. There is also seating at the bar, as well as stools overlooking the brewing operation. There is outdoor seating in a small deck out front with picnic tables. At this time there is no food available for purchase other than chips, etc. However they told us that customers are welcome to bring in outside food and that they will be inviting and featuring different restaurants to prepare food for customers on occasion. The location is a bit off the beaten path (near I-5 Exit 111), so they will need to rely on word of mouth. It looks comfortable and inviting and I am sure it will become one of our regular stops for a cold beer.",12-Apr-14,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58549-d6527651-r200874101-Top_Rung_Brewing_Company-Lacey_Washington.html

"The Emerald Queen Casino International Restaurant is located upstairs next to the buffet. We weren't hungry enough to pay the $25 or so each for the buffet, so we ordered from the menu. I had the Chef Salad and my husband had the Ahi. The Ahi presentation was very nice. He said it tasted great. My salad was also very good and very large. Our server was delightful.

"This was our first visit to this Queen Anne neighborhood restaurant. It has a bar side and a dining area. The décor is funky diner-style. The place is not too large. We had 4 children and 4 adults in our party and sat near an older couple who were seated in a booth. With 8 at our noisy table, we got icy looks from them throughout dinner. We saw many other tables with kids, so beware this is a family-friendly place. The children's menu is large, so no complaints there. I had the Burritilada which came with black beans and side salad. I found everything to be too spicy. My husband had the Satchmo's Red Beans and Rice. He said it was not very tasty. Service was good.

Lots of interesting stuff to see -  It is a large and spaced-out museum. Has a really cool and HUGE area that is set up like a concert area where they were showing concert videos - but there is hardly any seating so mostly you have to stand around (or it on a dirty floor). The science fiction area was by far my favorite.  I wish that I could have sat in Captain Kirk's chair.  Worth a visit but doesn't take as long to go through as I thought it would.,17-Feb-14,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d146840-r194467541-Museum_of_Pop_Culture-Seattle_Washington.html

"The Pattaya Thai Cuisine is located in a small strip mall, behind a gas station off of Martin Way. The décor is good and the restaurant had a nice busy vibe when we went on a Friday night. There was a lot of staff on hand but they seemed to be tripping over each other. They took our small plates when they shouldn't, took our silverware, and just generally undid what other servers had done. We were never sure just who our wait person was. We ordered the Egg Rolls and they were delivered with the centers ice cold - so obviously they were frozen, not freshly made. We had to send them back. We had the Pad Thai and the Pineapple Fried Rice. I would rate each dish as mediocre. Service was slow. It took a long time for our appetizer and our dinners to come out. When ordering our drinks, I asked if they had tea and they missed a chance to offer me the Thai Tea, which I am not familiar with. They brought me regular hot tea. Later I asked what that delicious orange drink was that other customers were drinking. By then though I was done and we were ready to leave. So in summary: mediocre food and uneven service. We won't be back. Instead we'll head to the Lemon Grass just down the road.",17-Jan-14,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58549-d3294215-r191193931-Pattaya_Thai_Restaurant-Lacey_Washington.html
"I'm giving the Homestead Restaurant a Poor rating because it was hard to get past the dinginess of the place. The restaurant resembles a red barn. It is sandwiched in between car lots in undesirable South Tacoma. The décor is country, which is fine, but it is in need of a complete cleaning and overhaul - even the concrete leading to the front doors is black with grime. The entry is supposed to be a bakery but there were just a few items in the display case, and other than the huge cinnamon rolls, things didn't look fresh or appetizing. There are benches lined up in rows that resemble pews in a church - very odd. The carpet in the restaurant is filthy! It's hard to sit and enjoy food when one is surrounded with such disgusting grime. However, for the sake of writing a Trip Advisor review, we stayed. Plus, we were really hungry. The food was pretty good. Portions were large. Breads appeared homemade. I had the Club Sandwich with the soup. It was a Potato Ham soup which was spiced so heavily with a green herb (?) that it was uneatable. Service was a bit slow. The waitress failed to check with us to see if the food was o.k. When we were finished, she removed the full soup bowl and didn't ask if there was a problem with it. (2 strikes for the waitress) The meal - Senior breakfast, Club Sandwich, and coffees came to $24.65 before tip. This restaurant has been there for such a long time. It has decent hearty food . It just needs a good cleaning and update. I mean, there's charming old-fashioned country, then there is just old-fashioned dirty junk.",06-Jan-14,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58775-d3570673-r189936130-Homestead_Restaurant_Bakery-Tacoma_Washington.html

"The Deschutes Brewery, walking distance from Powell's Books, Sur la Table, Whole Foods, North Face, REI, etc., is a great place to stop and take a break from shopping. The décor reminded us of being at a ski resort (think Whistler). We had the grilled cheese sandwich, which we were glad we shared because it was huge. And we tried the French Onion soup. The food and the beer were both excellent. The restaurant was packed with Christmas shoppers, and our wait to be seated was about 15 minutes. Service was a bit slow because they were so busy. The restaurant had a fun Christmas tree made of wood and beer bottles, which sets the tone of fun for this place.

"This restaurant is at the corner of a strip mall next to a busy road - nothing special about the location. The atmosphere is also o.k., nothing fancy. Two huge TVs dominate the walls. This was only my second time at trying Korean food. It's spicy and it's pretty good. We sat at a booth with a BBQ in the center and ordered the all you can eat at $25 per person. We got several small dishes with spicy vegetables, rice, soup, and a large platter of cut chicken, beef, and pork. The meats were nicely marinated. The evening we went there was a large group of about 10 people so our service was spotty. For example, I had to ask for a refill on the soda. I wanted a third refill, but that did not happen. Water was never offered. I asked for more rice and it was never delivered. There seemed to be only two workers, with one waitress handling all the tables. The dining experience was o.k., but even with ""all you can eat"", everything was so similar it leaves you feeling full but unsatisfied. Something sweet at the end of the meal would have been nice.

"[""On our 2 week trip in Cuba, we stayed almost every night in a different Casa Particular.  Villa Elisa was the tackiest and most uncomfortable one!  The décor is a cluttered mixture of unmatched pieces and knick-knacks.  Our bedroom was up the narrowest winding stairway we have ever seen (not up to code, we're sure).  The bedroom and bathroom appeared dusty and icky.  The hosts were a bit strange and the whole experience uncomfortable.

"Our family stopped for lunch at the Highlander. First impression - not good. It has the look and feel of a local bar. The restaurant / bar is crowded with tables, chairs, photos, even a disco ball. The food was o.k. for lunch until it got to the ice cream. We ordered a butterscotch shake. We got a vanilla shake. I ordered a German chocolate ice cream. I got vanilla with a little bit of butterscotch taste. Our waitress blamed it on a new girl. During our meal our waitress asked to close out our tab because of a shift change. The waitresses / cooks were loud and the ""new"" waitress who took over our table clearly didn't know what to do. We had stopped at the Highlander because of the big Ice Cream banner. They need to get their act together on that!",02-Aug-13,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60907-d600827-r170450490-Highlander_Steakhouse_Lounge-Ashford_Washington.html
"On the way to Mt. Rainier, we stopped for dinner. The prices were extremely expensive for a small town roadside diner. The restaurant is set inside a railroad car. The food was o.k., with the exception of the Hobo Stew in a Breadbowl which was really, really good. There was another table of 4 customers besides us, so they weren't busy. However, service was slow and our waitress annoyingly chatty.",01-Aug-13,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58453-d4944088-r170362604-Mt_Rainier_Railroad_Dining_Co-Elbe_Washington.html
"Like most other reviewers, we were taken to El Guajirito by the Peditaxi guys - they said they would get lunch out of it. The prices were outrageously high - $16 for a meal; $12 for a pizza - plus a tacked on service fee. The waitresses were very pushy for us to order expensive drinks and dishes. Needless to say, we had a snack and left. This restaurant has multiple personalities: waitresses in cowboy hats and belly dancers. This is not typical Cuba. This is a tourist trap. Don't bother with this place.",29-Jul-13,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147271-d1633948-r169810161-El_Guajirito-Havana_Ciudad_de_la_Habana_Province_Cuba.html
"We had been eating at paladars, so El Aljibe was a welcome change. It is a very nice, open-air restaurant known for its chicken. Our group of 6 had the chicken, picadillo, rice, black beans, fried malanga, and plantains. We also had the best bread in Cuba. The food was very tasty. Prices were reasonable (about $10 per meal), as you could get refills. We also had drinks, flans, and a coffee. Total bill for our party of 6: $98.",29-Jul-13,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147271-d969373-r169811568-Restaurante_El_Aljibe-Havana_Ciudad_de_la_Habana_Province_Cuba.html
"We found this great taberna steps away from the Casa Particular where we were staying. It was a welcome change from the monotonous Paladar menus, with presentation and service to match. The décor is awesome Spanish Colonial, and the live music during dinner was nice without being overbearing. For dinner the 3 of us had great mariquita chips, complimentary roasted peanuts, tamal appetizer, hamburger, spaghetti, pizza, 2 beers, 4 sodas, 3 waters all for approximately $26 CUC. We highly recommend La Botija.",28-Jul-13,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g285731-d3475600-r169459716-Taberna_La_Botija-Trinidad_Sancti_Spiritus_Province_Cuba.html
"We were generally happy with our dinner at Ray's Boathouse. The evening was beautiful and we enjoyed pre-dinner drinks on the deck. A very cool touch was that the hostess went around handing out sunglasses to those who needed them. Nice customer service! Our dinner was good; not excellent. It seemed very overpriced (entrees starting at $30+ and going up to $63), and the typical bread basket that most restaurants include with dinner was an extra $3. I had the pasta with crab which came with a lot of corn - an odd addition to pasta. It was o.k. Before our entrees were served, the Manager came to explain that our chicken had looked overcooked and she didn't want to serve it like that, so a new one was being prepared. She offered a complimentary Caesar salad for the wait. Again, nice touch. The Chocolate Feuilletine was good, as was the Strawberry Mousse, but again, tiny portions and very expensive. The view is awesome and service was excellent, but those high prices will keep us away.",08-Jul-13,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d445300-r166858505-Rays-Seattle_Washington.html
"We were celebrating the 4th of July in Steilacoom, and of course the place was PACKED! (street fair and parade just outside their door). The servers were very nice and were trying their hardest, but they just couldn't keep up. When the food finally arrived, it was all very good. I had the Monte Cristo French Toast. It was huge and delicious. The kids' meals were also good. The atmosphere is excellent and historical. Next time we'll leave room for those good looking ice cream cones they were serving!",04-Jul-13,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58766-d519369-r166332754-The_Bair_at_The_Bair_Drug_Hardware-Steilacoom_Washington.html
"Norma's is a small old-fashioned burger joint on noisy, busy Martin Way. The other evening, looking for a restaurant where we could eat outdoors and enjoy the warm weather, we stopped there for dinner. We had the veggie burger with grilled sweet Walla Walla onions, a fish burger, fries, and a fresh strawberry milkshake. Delicious! Everything was great, and specially sitting outdoors, kicking off the flip-flops, and wiggling our toes in the grass. It was a bit pricey, but hey, it's not McDonald's.",30-Jun-13,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d1191799-r165827752-Norma_s_Burger-Olympia_Washington.html
"Johnny's Dock offers views of the boats and waterway. It's a very nice spot, although for non-Tacoma natives, a bit difficult to find. The restaurant is in need of a good update. It still has the 1970s look and feel. We went for lunch and the food was average at best. The bread basket came with cold, buttered pieces of French bread. The clam chowder was ""o.k."". The lettuce on the salad was room temperature. And service was a bit slow. I don't think we'll be returning any time soon.",27-Jun-13,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58775-d629270-r165491198-Johnny_s_Dock_Restaurant_Marina-Tacoma_Washington.html

"We usually love O'Blarney's for a quick meal and a beer. However, a bad waitress can spoil the experience. We weren't greeted, had to ask for napkins and silverware (there were two of us dining and she brought only one set and we had to ask again for the other!), and she was hurried and unfriendly. I tried the Fish Tacos which were a failure. It was a deep-fried piece of cod in a taco shell. It was like wrapping a piece of your Fish and Chips in a taco shell. Not good. So this time, we were disappointed.",16-Jun-13,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d2360567-r164162485-O_Blarney_s_Irish_Pub-Olympia_Washington.html
"On a weekday lunch hour, the place was packed. The pizzas, pasta, and salad buffet is probably why. It is a very good value and comes with the sodas. The food was tasty. However, service was slow when we ordered something off the menu for the kids. We waited and waited... finally, we got a piece of pepperoni pizza off the buffet for our 5 year old who was almost crying with hunger. Service was friendly, but the kitchen a bit slow on the orders during the lunch rush.",16-Jun-13,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58793-d3580977-r164168912-The_Brick_on_Trosper-Tumwater_Washington.html
"We celebrated a birthday at the Falls and while we weren't disappointed, we weren't ""wowed"" either. The view of the Tumwater Falls is very pretty and the lodge-type décor of the restaurant and bar is nice. The food, we thought, was over-priced for the quality and the presentation. Nothing tasted really exciting. Service was o.k., however not terribly friendly. And the waitress mysteriously vanished after delivering our checks. We finally got up and paid in the front.

"This restaurant, situated in the charming foot-traffic only Espanola Way, drew us in due to its authentic décor. Step out of the Miami Beach scene and into Italy. The bustling atmosphere and décor is great with wine bottles, meat and cheese counters, and real Italian staff. The service was fast and efficient. The food was delicious to say the least! Be prepared to pay for the experience though. It was very expensive! (And Baby Boomers beware: It is dark inside and reading the menu was impossible.

Yes, it does have that dated ""diner"" look, but it has a large sit-down counter and lots of tables. We stopped for breakfast and everything was delicious. We had the Café con Leche and a Cortadito, as well as Pastelitos de Guayaba and the Cuban Toast. Portions were huge but all so good we didn't have any problem eating it all.

Nice work out room that was perfect to use and keep me on my work out regime.  We enjoyed the Beach one day and it was nice with chair, and umbrella service, and we sat by the pool the next day, very nice with great service, Maria was outstanding, as were the Mojitos!

"This restaurant is easy to miss. It is not in the typical restaurant areas, and frankly, from the outside we really weren't sure how good it would be. We walked in and were pleasantly surprised at the elegant décor. The restaurant is on the small side, but it is decorated very well. And the food was delicious!! The Roast Pork al Mojo was incredible. Everything was very well seasoned and so tasty! Our greeter was a very nice, friendly young man who prepared a great Pina Colada. Our waitress was a bit on the quiet side and not very outgoing. She also made a bad mistake for a waitress. We ordered Arroz con Leche for dessert and what she brought out was something like Pudin de Pan. When we said that wasn't Arroz con Leche, she said yes it is. We tasted it, and it was good, but it was not Arroz con Leche. When she returned she said she didn't know what Arroz con Leche was. (In a Cuban restaurant!?). That was the only negative thing. We would return in a second for the good food!",05-Jun-13,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34439-d1068583-r163133483-Bella_Cuba-Miami_Beach_Florida.html
"Thank you for taking the time to write such a thorough review of The Merriweather. Unfortunately, I believe that while you were here we had some pretty bad weather. Hopefully your next trip to Ft. Lauderdale will be as sunny as we know it to be! We have taken into consideration all of the things you have mentioned and we are looking into what you mentioned as a ""moldy"" shower door. You're right, we don't have an elevator, restaurant, spa or bar. However we are among the best restaraunts/bars and spas in Ft. Lauderdale. As you can see from our many excellent reviews and our many repeat guests, that this is part of the charm of our place. We are one of the only small, quaint and friendly places left on Ft. Lauderdale beach and it makes us stand apart from all of the big ""chain"" hotels. We do have hairdryers (in the office for borrow) and we do supply soap in the rooms as well. The difference between us and a big resort is that all of the things you mentioned in your review (beach chairs and umbrellas, lotion etc) are FREE here. Parking alone at a ""resort"" in town can cost up to $30 per day and we have free parking. All of our ammenities are listed on our website as well as RCI's. We hope you will try us again.

"We LOVED Tap 42! The décor and ambience is upscale, and we were surprised by the gourmet food. We were expecting regular bar food, but food choices, presentation, and taste were excellent. We went on a Tuesday evening around 7 and the place was packed. We waited about 1/2 hour or more for a table. We had the Turkey Dinner (odd choice, but it sounded good) and the Meatloaf. Both were elegant and delicious and not your regular diner stuff. There are so many beers to choose from, it's difficult to select, but they will bring you a taste. Service was friendly and welcoming. Prices were a bit high ($7 or $8 for a beer) with less $ for specials.

"I grew up eating Cuban food, and now live in the Pacific Northwest where, alas, there are not many (or any) Cuban restaurants. So when we visit Florida, the first thing I want is Cuban food! We were very happy with the food at Las Vegas Cuban Cuisine. The tamal was delicious, the black beans - just right. The sangria was very good also. They were very busy on a Sunday evening (Memorial Day weekend), and service was a bit slow. Our only negative was that our young waiter did not speak Spanish. A big part of going to a Cuban restaurant for me is the ambiance and Cuban feel, so this took away that. As other reviewers have said, the restaurant is in a strip mall. But the décor inside is very nice, and there is parking right in front.",28-May-13,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d474035-r162102164-Las_Vegas_Cuban_Cuisine-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html

We didn't order any food, but the other diners' meals looked good with huge portions. One of the near-by bars has an outdoor pool and young crowd. Their music was very loud. Shooters was o.k., nothing outstanding. The brick outdoor deck and tables seemed a bit dirty / worn. We wanted a ""beachy"" outdoor feel bar.

As soon as we walked in the Casino, everyone was hitting the machines. I looked around and everyone that was playing was winning! We played a little before hitting the pool and that's when the party started. The pool was packed and the DJ was mixing it up for all age groups. The people were all having fun and it was a great day overall! The accomadations are always top notch and I would tell anyone looking for a great spot to stay that this place has everything you need in one location.

"There are very few upscale shops.  If you want beach clothes, you'll find a better selection than on the beach.  Prices seem high for what you get.  Several nice galleries and a good selection of restaurants for lunch or dinner.  Check with your hotel for coupons or just ask a restaurant if they have any two for one entree coupons.  Parking is on side streets or lots behind shops.  Restaurants have free parking in back.  Chico's is always a nice store to shop with friendly clerks.  Make sure you go to the Farmers Market across from Wells Fargo on Saturday morning.  It's small but good vegetables and reasonable prices.  Go to ""A Touch of Spain"" for good olive oil and olives.  Fresh fruit drink is next door to it.

"We tried Hop Jacks for the first time on a Friday evening. The place was packed. The restaurant / pub is medium size. The pub area is actually larger than the restaurant. There is a small outside seating area as well. For dinner we had the veggie burger and the chicken penne. The chicken penne was good; not excellent. The burger, however, was very, very good. It was packed with condiments and had the best tasting sauce (""goop""). We also had the zucchini tempura and it was delicious. Service was good even though they were very busy. The only (negative) comment my husband made was that IPA and ale beers should not be served so cold. The atmosphere reminded us of The Ram in Lacey, yet smaller, but the food was tastier at Hop Jacks.",18-May-13,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58549-d1913357-r161091304-Hops_N_Drops-Lacey_Washington.html

"We treated Mom to dinner on Mother's Day. The restaurant was packed, and given that it was a popular day to eat out, the slower service was somewhat excusable. The restaurant has a panoramic view of the Tacoma harbor and probably of Mt. Rainier, even though on this evening, the mountain was not visible. The entry to the restaurant is small and it was weird that they had roses and a bottle of perfume (?) as decorations on the Hostess stand. The Hostess looked stressed and was not particularly friendly. Service was SLOW, prices were expensive, and the food nothing outstanding. There were three of us. We had 2 glasses of wine, 1 beer, 3 entrees, and 1 dessert and the bill came to $136 before tip. The entrees came with a bread basket but with nothing else. The smoked salmon fettuccine was dry and the smoked salmon were mere slivers. The halibut and the scallops entrees were also nothing spectacular. Our waiter was personable, but service was very slow. We were not impressed, and at these prices we'll go somewhere else where the food is awesome.",13-May-13,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58775-d913972-r160586990-Cliff_House_Restaurant-Tacoma_Washington.html

"We tried this restaurant because it was rated highly on Trip Advisor, otherwise we never would have seen it! It is outside the center of town in a small strip mall. The food was very good and the portions generous. My husband really liked his breakfast and said it tasted, ""right off the griddle"". I had a Chef Salad which was o.k., nothing spectacular. The café was packed with regulars. Service was friendly. The décor is 1960s with golf paraphernalia, and it probably needs an update. If they were trying to achieve a ""historic restaurant"" feel, this isn't it. Usually we don't carry much cash, but were glad we did on this occasion because they don't take credit cards. Would we go out of our way to return? Probably not.",06-Apr-13,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58686-d899833-r156823570-Uncle_Dave_s_Cafe-Port_Orchard_Washington.html
"From the front, Doc's Marina Grill looks like a very small local restaurant. If it had not been for its high ratings on Trip Advisor, I doubt if we would have stopped there for dinner. We're glad we did! It has a very nice, cozy bar; a large dining room; and a very large deck with a great view of the marina and the ferry. We sat at the enclosed deck with heaters, and it was great. The restaurant has a good beer and wine selection. My husband had the Blackened Salmon Burger. He said it was excellent. It came with onions grilled in balsamic vinegar (very tasty!). The fries were extra good. I had the special (halibut, rice, and asparagus). It was very good, but a bit pricey at $24 since it didn't include a salad or bread for the dinner. We went on a Friday early evening and were surprised at the number of families with children. But then we noticed that they have crayons and a great children's menu and the place is very welcoming. We'll definitely keep Doc's in mind next time we visit - a cold beer on the outdoor deck in the summer sounds just fine.",06-Apr-13,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58342-d866692-r156824915-Doc_s_Marina_Grill-Bainbridge_Island_Washington.html

"What a nice suprise, great wine made right here in Olympia.

"Our group of friends, 5 of us, met for dinner at the Outback. I hadn't been there since they opened, and now I remember why. The restaurant is located in a strip mall. The decor is plain and ordinary. Service was good, but they put us right next to the door serving the ""To Go"" food, and we got hit with cold air every few minutes. The food was unexceptional. We started with the signature Bloomin' Onion - a greasy gimmick. For the entree, I ordered the Alice Springs Chicken. The portion of chicken was very small, and it was overcooked and not very tasty. Two in our group had the soup of the day - Tortilla - and one couldn't eat it because she didn't like the taste. Other orders included the Macaroni and Cheese with Lobster. The macaroni and cheese was good, but it was hard to find any lobster. And, the bread that came with dinner was not warm. My tab for the chicken entree (no soup or salad) and a glass of wine was $21 before tip -- pretty expensive for the quality of the food and so-so atmosphere.",30-Jan-13,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d463608-r151055786-Outback_Steakhouse-Olympia_Washington.html

"OK this is not quite the London Eye but the next best thing! The hours vary and they do not list them on the website. I did complain to them about this as I was there at 9:30am for an 11am opening time. I had heard the lines get long so I wanted to get on early. There is not much to do at the waterfront if you are there too early so I hiked back up to 1st Ave for window shopping. OK so this was great, alittle scary at the top as the wind was blowing and the gondola was swaying as they were letting people on below. They do have a ""help"" button if the ride is not for you. I loved this attraction! The views were great. The gondola is all glass around the sides so you can see the entire panorama of Seattle and beyond. During the summer season when it is most popular, I would purchase tickets ahead of time. Now, in December, it is not such a problem except if it is the only partly sunny day of the week.",22-Dec-12,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d3308043-r147925533-Seattle_Great_Wheel-Seattle_Washington.html

The decor is awesome (all from salvaged and repurposed materials). It's dark woods, eclectic, and has a very warm and welcoming feel. We particularly liked the collection of oil portraits on the wall. Service was excellent and friendly. And the food, fantastic! I had the best macaroni and cheese ever! The others had the pickle-brined chicken, leg of lamb, and mussels. There is a great variety of beers on tap. We had a great evening with great service, atmosphere, food, and drinks.

"This long-time Olympia restaurant is so unassuming from the outside that it's hard to see how it attracts customers. We knew of it and had peeked inside before, so based on TripAdvisor reviews, decided to give it a try. The food was delicious, but I'll get back to that later. The front of the restaurant is an old garage door. When you first enter the restaurant, you see a dark wood-paneled small area with dark red curtains, several plain unadorned tables and booths, and a modern bar. Everything is dark with zero natural light. (It reminded us of a cheap motel bar) There is nobody greeting customers at the door. So you wonder, is this a private bar, or what?? The restaurant/bar was empty on an early Friday evening. There was one server and one bartender, yet service was slow and lethargic. We ordered the Manchego cheese appetizer ($9.75), which came with several pieces of cheese and the same bread and olive oil we were served with dinner. So basically we paid almost $10 for the cheese! We had the fettucini carbonara and the winter pasta special - all very delicious. The side of Italian squash ($5) turned out to be steamed zuchini; not very exciting. Out total bill with 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers, but no dessert, came to almost $100 with tip. So even though the food was very good, if we're going to have a nice dinner out, we will go someplace where the atmosphere and service is better. (By the way, the atmosphere would greatly improve if they let in some natural light and set the tables)",10-Nov-12,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d621125-r145088592-The_Mark-Olympia_Washington.html
This Lacey restaurant has been in business for decades. It's a vintage pizza parlor on Martin Way with walls covered in aged posters and funny signs. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. You order and pay at the counter. There are several separate dining rooms perfect for parties or after sports get togethers. We always get the Jake sandwiches which we love! Yesterday we went with the family and ordered pizzas and the cheesy bread as well. The crust was a bit thin and the pizza is not the best. We recommend a beer and the Jake sandwich and you won't be disappointed.,03-Nov-12,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d451226-r144399941-Dirty_Dave_s_Gay_Nineties-Olympia_Washington.html
"Pomodoro is in the quaint Proctor district of Tacoma. It has the feel of a friendly local restaurant where one could easily become a regular. The decor is very nice. On a Sunday early evening the place was lively and inviting. We were greeted immediately and seated right away. We had the Smoked Salmon Penne and the Spaghetti with Marinara. The entrees came with a choice of soup or salad. Portions on both the salads and the dinners were huge. Everything was delicious and prices are very reasonable! The only negative on the food is that you better like garlic because both entrees and salads had heavy garlic flavor. (Luckily, we like garlic.) For dessert we shared the Jack Daniels Bread Pudding and the server generously gave us extra whipping cream and ice cream. Yummy! We were very happy with everything but have a couple of ""nit-picky"" complaints: the bread which came with dinner was neither warm nor fresh; and the restaurant uses paper napkins which isn't very elegant. Otherwise, all great. We'll be back!",29-Oct-12,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58775-d464107-r143997420-Pomodoro-Tacoma_Washington.html
"The Farmboy Restaurant is not a Drive-in (not sure why that's in the title). It's a side-of-the-road (near I-5) local cafe. It's between Tumwater and Centralia. The decor and cleanliness look like they date back to the early 1980s. There are a couple of picnic tables in the grassy area in front. We've stopped there to grab lunch a couple of times when we've been in the area. The food is the typical cafe fare - high calorie fried foods. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and you can get your order to go. For lunch, we had the BLT and fries and it was adequate. This is not a ""destination"" restaurant; however, if you're in the area and need to eat, then this place if fine and seems to be the only restaurant around. (They do have large cinnamon rolls, homemade pies, and milkshakes which we didn't try and might be delicious.

The dinner came with warm, delicious bread. The meal was all very tasty and well presented. There was excellent live music in the bar, but on this Monday evening, we were the ONLY customers! There was a large party in the private dining area, but the bar was empty which felt strange. Our dinner took a very long time to arrive. The server said the Jerk Chicken takes a long time to make.

"We were visiting Yakima and ""found"" the Second Street Grill. Our first impression was ""WOW""! The restaurant is beautifully done, upscale, and very nice. It has a great outside seating area, and a large bar. This was the Labor Day weekened, so they were packed on a Sunday night. Service was extremely slow and the food was, frankly, all bad. The bread basket had warm dark bread, but it was a bit hard and stale. My side salad was not cold and crisp. My husband had the giant chili burger and said the meat was burnt. I had the Grilled Mahi Mahi. The fish was overcooked, the rice was hard and cold, and the steamed broccoli was hard. We would NOT recommend eating dinner here. The bar looks very nice, so maybe just go for drinks and try an appetizer.",04-Sep-12,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58838-d1468619-r139382938-Second_Street_Grill-Yakima_Washington.html
"Not being familiar with Yakima, we drove by the Yakima Sports Center several times without realizing it was a bar/restaurant. We noticed the interesting revolving vintage hunter with shooting gun sign (which the show American Pickers would probably love to get). We thought it was an old sports shop. Anyway, on Labor Day, pretty much nothing else was opened, so we stopped for lunch. We sat outside (nothing fancy here, just the sidewalk) and had the grilled pork with slaw, the grilled ahi sandwich, and the sweet potato fries. Everything was super delicious! Service was great. We were so glad we ate there. The place inside is a throw-back to a 1960s or earlier sports bar.

For dinner, I had the gorgonzola & wild mushroom sauce over fried polenta, and it was delicious.

"We reserved a 2 bedroom condo for 4 nights in May 2012, Tuesday-Friday, during our childrens' spring break.  I called 2 weeks prior to our stay to double check our confirmation # worked. Everything seemed ok and we were VERY excited about our vacation.  I was told that  early check-in's available on occasion.  So, after driving through the night from central KY we showed up at their door at 11:00 am.  At the time, we were told by the staff that the room wasn't clean so we should come back in 2 hours.  That's understandable since we were actually early.  After lunch, I decided to call to see if the condo was ready... The lady who answered the phone asked for my confirmation # which I readily gave her.  There was a very long pause and then she commenced to tell me that they did NOT actually have a condo reserved for my family.  At first I thought she was confused so I repeated that I had a reservation.  She told me that their hotel booking policy was similiar to an airplane scheduler in that it often double books in expectation for someone cancelling... and since no one cancelled we were out of luck.  We drove straight to the hotel and asked for the manager.  The manager on duty was Mark Floyd.  He gave me a different story, but the end result was that they would not honor our reservation (which was paid in advance with Travelocity) because they were completely full.  He told me that some of their guests had decided to extend their reservations past their original check-out dates and that in the state of FL they are not allowed to deny such a request.  Basically, he said that once you're in, you don't have to leave.  To me that sounds like FL supports squatter's rights which I find very hard to believe... now I don't know which story was right, but either way really sucked for our family.  We were left tired from an overnight 14 hr drive with a 4yr old and a 6 yr old that were ready to see Disney and no place to go.  At this point I have to admit I kinda lost it which I think is understandable.  I worked for a hotel back in college and the whole idea of turning away a paying customer with a reservation was beyond belief!  I was doubtful that they wouldn't let anyone else in for the rest of the day so we stayed in the lobby for 2 hours.  Family after family came in (with reservations) and were turned away.  The manager offered to get us a comparable room at a different resort.  I do hours of research leading up to a vacation and I plan well in advance using customer reviews to determine where to stay so I KNEW that there was nothing comparable in the area.  But, eventually we accepted his offer because we didn't have any other choice.  The comparable hotel was absolutely disgusting.  The carpet was pulling up off the floor and was stained in multiple places, there were black dots on the sheets, and it backed up to a trailer park.  I called their front desk upon arrival and they said someone would be right over to clean the sheets. 2 hrs later and no service.  I spent another two hours with Travelocity trying to find somewhere else to stay.  Due to a convention being held in Orlando and being in the middle of spring break Travelocity was unable to find A SINGLE ROOM FOR US TO STAY IN THE GREATER ORLANDO AREA.  We were forced to relocate our entire vacation.  We settled on driving back north to St. Augustine.  So, we pretty much lost a full day of our vacation from 11 AM to 9 PM (when we finally checked in at St. Augustine), not to mention that visiting the parks became out of the question.  We have been in communication with the property several times since the fiasco.  I actually recieved a voucher for a free week's stay which we are going to TRY to use during fall break if they honor our reservation.  I have to say that I am leary of even going back regardless if it's free.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  But, we're going to give it a try.  This time we're booking Sat-Sat.  I know people will be leaving on a Saturday so if we're the first ones there we ought to be able to get a condo... I'll let you know how it goes.",12-Aug-12,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d85347-r136986227-Diamond_Resorts_Grand_Beach-Orlando_Florida.html

"We were four adults and two kids hungry and tired after a day at the theme park, so we tried the Golden Corral to get something quick and easy. Mistake! It was a Wednesday night and there was a long line to enter and the place was packed. The traffic flow of this restaurant is awful. The tables are too close to the food and there is not enough room for all the people walking around serving themselves. People are crisscrossing, spilling, cutting in. I pointed out a piece of chicken spilled on the carpet to one of the employees and he just shrugged and walked on. The food was pretty bad. The salad selections were poor. The vegetables were way overcooked, swimming in water. Buffet platters sat empty and were not refilled. The very popular chocolate fountain is smack in the middle of a narrow walkway. Kids were helping themselves, touching the food, etc. The ONLY thing we found good and tasty were some baked buns. At $12.99 per adult for the buffet, plus extra for the sodas, those were some awfully expensive buns!",11-Aug-12,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d644933-r136937039-Golden_Corral-Orlando_Florida.html

"Our son is married to a woman from Marseille, so we went there together to try the featured Marseille menu. The food was generally very good and tasty. I had the seasonal greens with fresh goat cheese, which was delicious. My son had the octopus salad. He liked it, but said it had very little octopus. My husband said his caesar salad was just o.k. The crepe entree was very good, as was the salmon canebiere. My husband had the tuna which he thought was good but skimpy on the portion. Service was o.k. but not necessarily friendly, and we had to ask for bread twice - once to get it, and the second time for a refill. Desserts were disappointing. The chocolate dessert was dry and the key lime pie was not sweet enough. However, we had drinks, salads, entrees, and desserts for 3 adults for $123 before tip. Not bad value. The atmosphere is not fancy, but has character. The restaurant changes menu quarterly to feature coastal areas around the world. We'll probably give it another try sometime when we're in Capitol Hill.",22-Jul-12,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d433194-r135098195-Coastal_Kitchen-Seattle_Washington.html

"We love Ferndale! We were passing through and had dinner at The Ivanhoe. The Ivanhoe Saloon and Restaurant is in a historic Victorian hotel. The decor is cozy. Our meal and service was very good, and prices were very reasonable. The only (minor) complaint we have is that the young woman clearing the dishes was quick and abrupt. She took my bread plate, with a piece of bread still on it, without asking if I was finished. She actually never said a word to us as she cleared the dishes.

"The Fireside Pizza Company is located in a corner spot with views of the mountain. The restaurat has a lodge-look and nice outdoor seating. Drinks are served in large wide-mouth canning jars. We found the draft beer selection to be a bit limited, however, the food was excellent. My salad was large with lots of chicken and fresh parmesan. My husband ordered the Italian Herb Shrimp Penne and he said it was very, very good. Next time we'll try the pizza and the Brownie Avalanche dessert.

This restaurant has the feel of a seaside boardwalk restaurant with a view of the water. It's large with informal tables and benches. It has a very beachy feel. There were several young people working and service was very good and attentive. Prices seemed a bit high for what we got though. I ordered the Avocado Tuna Salad for $8.95. The avocado was tiny with a small scoop of tuna salad and a meager amount of lettuce. My husband had the chili and said it was good. With the mediocre food and high prices we left feeling like this is a tourist trap.,27-Jun-12,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51867-d666106-r132926377-Mo_s_Seafood-Florence_Oregon.html

"""Best Mexican Food in Town"" is what this restaurant claims. We were just passing through, so we don't know about other Mexican restaurants in Willits, but the food was very good and at a very reasonable price. Taqueria Jalos shares a building with a convenience store and gas station, so nothing fancy there. It's more of a fast food place. You order at the counter and they will bring it to the table along with a basket of chips and salsa. I had the tostada. It was large, authentic, and very good. My husband had the $5 special of 2 tacos, rice, and beans. The restaurant is clean, and has about 10 tables. Service was fast and friendly. We'll grab lunch there again next time we're in the area.",27-Jun-12,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33273-d2425397-r132927825-Taqueria_Jalos-Willits_Mendocino_County_California.html

"Enjoyed our stay at the Resort at Squaw Creek last weekend.  The resort is gorgeous in the summer with plenty of outdoor activites and great proximity to Lake Tahoe (a short 6 mile bike ride away!!)  Hiking, bicycling, golf, heated pools and multiple hot tubs.  Staff exceptionally friendly!  Room was clean and well appointed, beautiful views of valley, mountains and olympic village.  We were able to secure an early check-in and late check-out ...very nice!  Grabbed breakfast at the Sweet Potato Deli..good variety of options and free coffee refills all day.  Had a few drinks and snacks at Sandy's Pub..friendly, talkative bar staff and food was good.  Nice live music one afternoon.  We weren't travelling with children, but looked to be very child friendly for those looking for family vaca option.  Concierge was extremely helpful in booking and printing our tix for Tahoe Wine & Food Walk.  Pool complex very nice, heated pool and multiple hot tubs.  Slide and plunge pool for kiddies.  Nice pool bar with attentive staff.  Plenty of towels at all hours of day and night.  We rented bikes onsite, easy access to the bike path along the Truckee River and goes all the way to Tahoe.  Nicely maintained easy hiking trail over to Olympic Village - which has a few shops and restaurants.  You can hop on the resort shuttle for ride back if you're pooped. :-)",27-Jun-12,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32822-d78799-r132858321-Resort_at_Squaw_Creek-Olympic_Valley_Lake_Tahoe_California_California.html
"Hands down this restaurant has the best view in Olympia. Directly over the water and with outside seating, the Olympic Mountains and Budd Bay views are a must for out-of-town guests. The restaurant's decor is elegant contemporary. The bar is fairly big and has a nice Happy Hour menu. You can enjoy the view from most tables. The Chicken Cobb salad I ordered was large and chock full of delicious ingredients. My husband had the chicken penne which he said was very good. And the basket of crusty garlic and herbs bread was very, very tasty. The place was full and lively on a Friday evening yet service was professional, friendly and efficient.

However, service was slow and not particularly friendly even though the bar was not crowded - it looked like they had only one server. We had the Chop-Chop Salad and Salmon Sliders ($5 each) which were generous and a good value. The bar and restaurant have a lodge-river rock decor - very nice. The menu offers Northwest Cuisine.

We had a 4 year old with us and ordered a grilled cheese sandwich for him from the kids' menu, and it looked delicious! It came with apple slices and two Oreo cookies. The waitress also brought out baby carrots and dip for him right away - nice touch! The lunch prices are a tad high, but the food was excellent and we left full.

"Other than a drive-through and a Subway, this is the only place to eat at Steamboat Island. As the name implies, this is a local neighborhood bar. It is mostly a tavern, with a small family dining area in the back. We have eaten there a couple of times with the family and have been satisfied with the food. It is regular bar-type food - burgers, fries, chicken strips, etc. The family dining area is small and is more of a walk-through to the bar, but the kids like it because there are children's books and games. The wait staff has always seemed welcoming and has provided very good service. This is a good place to go for with the family for the quick dinner before or after school events as it is located across from Griffin School. And if you don't have minors with you, then sit in the tavern area and enjoy a cold beer and the food. If you are a local, you are sure to run into neighbors and friends.",14-May-12,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d2524121-r129929735-Character_s_Corner-Olympia_Washington.html
"I'm sitting in my room, writing this so I don't forget tomorrow.  This hotel was a pleasant surprise. I don't think it's been owned by the current franchisees for more than a couple of years as our car's GPS didn't have it listed but maybe that's why the price is great, it's clean, very spacious, well maintained with very friendly customer service. Continental breakfast is included with the room & when we checked in, we were told that we were welcome to come breakfast earlier than the advertised time because the kitchen would be open, due to another group needing an earlier breakfast time.  I will note that the bed is dbl, not the Q size on the reservation, so I'd advise that fact be clarified at check-in but I did not notice until after we'd come back to the room a 2nd time & had already used the room somewhat so I didn't bring it to anyone's attention. Based on the attitude we have experienced thus far though, I feel confident in saying that the proprietors would change our rooms, if requested, without a problem.  The location is convenient to everything in town. I didn't check the sleep quality as I haven't slept yet but the bed feels comfy.  We'll keep this in our ""return"" file for our next Ocean Shores visit. One last little addition: I like the fact that the bathroom counter has room for your toiletries - so many hotels don't anymore but there's actually room on the counter for both ""his"" and ""hers"" toiletry bags.

"We were very impressed with Bennett's Fish Shack. The decor is elegant-beachy. The booths are nice and big with several that can hold big groups. We also liked that in nice weather you can sit outside. The inside is very cute with the bar area built to resemble a crab shack. The service was friendly, helpful and super fast. I had the fish taco which was huge and came with a plateful of golden delicious fries. My husband had the halibut sandwich also with tons of fries.

If you're looking for a room on the coast with charm and a beach inn feel The Grey Gull is it.

"Passing through the area, we walked all of La Conner's attractive waterfront and found the busiest, liveliest restaurant, the La Conner Brewing Co. The atmosphere is elegant and hip. The place was packed, however, our server was very friendly. Because they were so busy on this Friday evening, service was a bit slow. My husband had the salmon burger which he said was excellent. I had the Asian Chicken Salad. It too, was very tasty. My only complaint was that it had very, very little chicken. It had several thin strips of chicken on top of a big bowl of greens. At $12 and considered an entree, I was expecting more substantial chunks of chicken. However, other diners' dishes looked delicious, especially the pizza and fish tacos. As for the beer, my husband tried the ESB, and said it was not as good as other ESBs.",31-Mar-12,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58545-d519350-r127027263-La_Conner_Brewing_Co-La_Conner_Washington.html

The restaurant is huge so we didn't experience any wait. Dishes were replenished quickly and everything seemed very clean and orderly. I highly recommend this restaurant when you're hungry for Chinese food. You can get your fill for less than $15 per adult.",14-Mar-12,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d2467743-r126116909-Super_Buffet-Olympia_Washington.html

However, I recently took my husband there for dinner, and to my disappointment, the dishes served were exactly the same as one year ago! They were even served in the same order. The concept of this restaurant is to bring out surprising dishes. I think they are missing the opportunity to expand their offerings, and provide new and exciting things on their menu.

"While visiting Victoria we decided a Chinese dinner at China Town would be fun. We walked around a bit and found Ocean Garden Restaurant on the corner of the main street. We were extremely disappointed. The entire meal was bland and tasteless. The meat was hard and dry. The sweet and sour pork was so hard and terrible we referred to it as ""mystery meat"". The almond chicken was dry and tasteless. The food arrived immediately, which was a bad sign. Obviously it was already cooked and sitting in the kitchen for who knows how long.

Our son, who is a talented chef, rated all the food 'excellent'. The menu and the wine list are very Italian. We had the rabbit meatballs, the ragu pasta special, and the braised duck. Everything we ordered was very well presented and served, and all very tasty. Service was excellent and knowledgeable. Prices for dinner (secondi) are in the $20+ range. Our tab for four with drinks, a bottle of wine, and a couple of desserts came to $234 before tip. The only negatives are that we didn't find more pasta dishes on the menu, and that seating in the restaurant can be uncomfortably close to other customers.

"My 4 year old grandson and I were having fun downtown Olympia and stopped at the 5th Avenue Sandwich Shop for lunch. This was our first visit and we were very pleased. The restaurant is quaint with country-style decor. My grandson specially liked the model trains on the walls. The place is narrow, not too big, and can be a bit dark in the back. But if you want sunlight, there are tables up front. The food was very good. I had the 1/2 sandwich and soup. The sandwich was generous and came with pickles and chips. The soup was the only disappointment. It was a cheese soup that literally tasted like melted Velvetta. My grandson's grilled cheese sandwich was big and came with pickles and applesauce. His meal was very, very inexpensive. Service was perfect. We had a very personable young man who was super. The young woman at the register was also very sweet. In fact when we mentioned that it was our first time there, she gave us each a big and delicious chocolate chip cookie! Can't beat that. Well, maybe you can.

"First impressions: Love the location (aside from the real first impression of parking - plenty, but back-in only!?) And love the elegant decor. Second impression: no host at the desk, and when he did show, he was pretty blah and dressed in baggy jeans. Throughout our dinner, puzzled customers would enter the restaurant and find no one to greet them because the host was doing double-duty pouring water, etc. - very bad impression for a nice restaurant! The restaurant has a couple of quieter separate dining rooms, but the main part was very loud because it is right against the bar. The bar is small, but it was quite lively and loud on a Friday evening. Our server took a while to bring our drinks because the bar was backed up in orders. The menu is small and unique; the wine list is extensive. We ordered the ravioli and pizza. The ravioli portion was very small (about 7 raviolis in a tomato sauce). My husband had the pizza which came on a wood board. (We had to request a dinner plate). Both dinners and service were unexeptional, and very expensive for what we got.

My grandson had already eaten so he had a very tiny and expensive gingerbread man cookie. This restaurant is laid back and casual. It reminds me of something in a Seattle or other big city neighborhood. Here you basically help yourself. You order at the counter and get your own table. The staff is young, eclectic, and just performing their jobs - not too much on the friendly or service-oriented side. The food seems varied and good. It's not your typical restaurant menu. They use tasty cheeses, herbs and spices, serve great breads, pastries, and coffees. So if you want a good breakfast or lunch eat there, just don't expect small hometown friendliness or service.",09-Dec-11,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d1066562-r121574109-The_Bread_Peddler-Olympia_Washington.html
"In the middle of Phoenix, yet you get the impression of space and calm, this hotel has bags of south western charm and drive up conveniece. The hotel is split into 'the hotel' and 'not the hotel', the latter of which are a set of family friendly cassitas often with their own pool, split level, underground parking, and lounge and upstairs bedrooms. choose these if you can, its just soooo different from a normal hotel experience. the kitchen could be better (theres only a large refrigerator, but room for a bigger kitchen...Hilton take note). Forget location, as presumably the visitors are there for the winter sun. The pool extravagance is a bit 70's, but the fitness centre is up to standard and for tennis freaks, 4 courts with guaranteed sunshine till the sun dips below the peak (and the 51), makes this an ideal stay for families and especially tennis and fitness enthusiasts. Add that to the proximity of newly developed malls on the 101 makes this hotel an ideal location for families and even business people who want some wholesome fun.",17-Nov-11,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d73957-r120719363-Hilton_Phoenix_Resort_at_the_Peak-Phoenix_Arizona.html

"This restaurant offers very average Mexican food, and lots of it. In addition to the big combination plate, our meal came with a choice of soup or tostada, which really wasn't necessary. Then when we finished our meals, the waiter brought fried bread with honey. That was really tasty, but we were stuffed. The service was prompt. The margaritas were good. But the food was just average. My taco had too much ground beef and not much else, and the enchilada (which was pretty tasteless) was hidden on the plate under a huge pile of shredded lettuce. I've had better Mexican food.",15-Nov-11,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60950-d334224-r120649203-Casa_Molina_Restaurant-Tucson_Arizona.html

"We have eaten at the Infernos in Tumwater several times, mostly for the lunch buffet (which is very good). Today we had a late lunch at their restaurant in Lacey on Martin Way. We love taking the kids to Infernos because it's very kid-friendly. In addition to the kids' menu that they can color, they have a bunch of toys that the kids can play with. Awesome idea! The service was a bit slow even though they weren't busy, but the toys and games kept the kids happy. The pizza was good - not outstanding, just good. And we had a coupon that we used, so that made it even better. The atmosphere is nice. Lots of room, TVs, toys for the kids, video games in the lobby. It's a great family restaurant. And we keep meaning to try the great-looking desserts!

"Applebee's likes to pretend they are your ""local neighborhood restaurant"". There is nothing local about this chain run-of-the-mill eatery. I ordered a garden burger with grilled onions. The onions were not grilled, but were maybe cooked in a microwave which made them cooked but tasteless. The hamburger bun was too small and the burger became a slippery mess to eat. The fries that came with it were not quite golden or crispy enough. My husband had the fish and chips which he said was o.k. Service was slow due to the fact that this restaurant is always packed. So mediocre food and slow service. Why eat there at all?",22-Oct-11,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58549-d463581-r119610400-Applebee_s-Lacey_Washington.html

We specially liked the original wood floor. We sat in the bar and had a huge plate of delicious french fries. We were very pleased with the prompt and friendly service as we had not encountered many friendly shopkeepers on the island earlier that day. It was nice to finally get a smile and a ""welcome"" out of the islanders.

My husband always has Chile Rellenos when dining in Mexican restaurants, and he said these were great. The portions were large and everything was tasty.

My husband ordered Pai Thai, Thai hot, but he said that it really wasn't all that spicy. I had a chicken dish cooked in coconut milk with peanut sauce and vegetables. It was very tasty. I would say that the overall eating experience was good and we will return.",14-Oct-11,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d464222-r119312544-Lemon_Grass_Restaurant-Olympia_Washington.html
"All was excellent! Forget you are in downtown Olympia. You are suddenly transported to Northern Italy! The restaurant is small, with elegant decor. This is definitely a great place for a special occasion. We began with a glass of wine and the tomato, mozzarella, basil appetizer. The tomatoes were perfectly ripe. The warm, fresh bread served was delicious and it came with humus in olive oil. Mmm! We each had a pasta dinner which were ample and very delicious. The dinner was served in a relaxed, slow style. The service was outstanding. We left room for dessert, and tried the chocolate cheesecake (very light and good), and the frozen chocolate, spicy mousse. An excellent, fun dining experience!

"We celebrated two family birthdays at the Pacific Grill and took advantage of the 1/2 price Happy Hour. The Happy Hour lasts most of the day/night, which is great. We had salads (delicious) and Cuban sandwiches which were very good and pretty authentic. They were served with house-made chips that were also very good. Service was great even though they were packed. We wanted to sit at the tables in the bar, but ended up having to sit at the stools. The bar area itself is very narrow, so it was a bit awkward with the large group that we had. However, the restaurant not only brought out delicious desserts for the birthday guys, but added complimentary desserts for the rest of our party! Super customer service, and super delicious! The decor of the restaurant is very elegant. It's a wonderful mix of the original walls and beams of the building, with great new glass artwork. We had a great time and a great dinner. We'll be back, but next time we'll make sure we get there early enough to grab one of the tables by the windows.",16-Sep-11,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58775-d948578-r118218179-Pacific_Grill-Tacoma_Washington.html
"We had dinner there after touring and admiring Percival Landing. The dinner was not up-to-par with a great restaurant. It was mediocre. I wanted a garden burger. They did not have, so I had the cod burger. It was like fish sticks on a bun - way too much batter, not enough fish, and obviously previously frozen. The fries that came with the dinner were nothing spectacular. My mother and sister had the shrimp wrap which came with raw onions, even though they had ordered it without. My father had the bowl of chowder which he pronounced good. However the bread that came with it was a simple, ordinary dinner roll (no warm bread basket). The food was so-so; however, the service was good and fast. This restaurant could improve on its menu by offering more fresh, interesting menu items. It's just a tired, boring menu now that was probably o.k. twenty years ago, but needs to be stepped up a bit with some delicious, fresh signature items.. Other than the location and views, this restaurant is just so-so.",12-Sep-11,30,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58653-d464218-r117989433-Olympia_Oyster_House-Olympia_Washington.html

"Not the best Mexican restaurant, that's for sure. The place is dark and crowded, inexplicably with lots of chairs lined up in the lobby, as if they are expecting a huge mob to suddenly appear. Service was lethargic and uninterested. The chips were stale. The selections are huge and I didn't want so much food. It actually costs more to order what I wanted in side orders, so I ordered a child's taco, beans, and rice plate (an extra $2 charge for an adult even though it was child-size portions). The food tasted o.k.; typical Mexican restaurant fare. This restaurant could be better with a face-lift - declutter and lighten it up. We go to Ocean Shores about once or twice a year. Next time we'll try another Mexican restaurant there or wait until we get to Hoquiam or Aberdeen.",11-Sep-11,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58648-d545411-r117943822-Las_Maracas_Mexican_Restaurant-Ocean_Shores_Washington.html
"I went for lunch with my daughter and grandsons, ages 7 and 3 1/2. My Pear Gorgonzola salad and Espresso con Panna (with whipped cream) were delicious. The best part for us though was the kid-friendly atmosphere. There are toy pizzas and books as you enter, and the kids get to make their own pizzas. There are a variety of gelatos for dessert. The atmosphere is casual, almost like something you would find in a mall, but the excellent food makes up for it.

We had dinner there before a show at the Key Arena. We were looking forward to great Thai food but we were pretty disappointed. It took a long time to get our food. A couple who was seated after us was finishing their dinner by the time we got ours. I had an Indian/Thai BBQ chicken that was pretty tasteless and very dry. The others' dinners were so-so also. The steamed rice was dry and we didn't get enough for a party of four.

"Passing through and hungry for dinner, we pulled off the highway at Ellensburg. A local woman, smoking on the sidewalk, recommended the Palace Cafe. First impression: Just a diner, nothing special. The interior is the typical diner decor even though the restaurant claims to have been serving Ellensburg for 100 years. Too bad it has been remodeled to death. There is no ""history"" there. I had the small serving of spaghetti and garlic bread; my husband ordered a chili burger. The spaghetti came in a small dish that I poured onto the larger dinner place. As I began eating, I found pieces of shredded lettuce in the food. I told the waiter who said the lettuce is placed under the spaghetti dish to keep it from sliding around. O.K., but yuck! - it was now in my dinner. No resolution was offered. Service was slow. The staff was young and having loud conversations about non-restaurant matters. The tab was high and we ended up wishing we had tried somewhere else.

It was a large piece of romaine lightly grilled and topped with chopped hardboiled eggs, crispy bacon, and delicious blue cheese. My husband had the salmon chowder which he said was delicious.

"We drove from Olympia for a Mother/Daughters Night Out and we had a great time. We had heard about this restaurant from other family members, so we knew what to expect. The restaurant is comfortable and quaint, not fancy. They have no menus, so be prepared to be pleasantly surprised with what is served. The staff was fun and friendly. The meal is served European style which means very tasty small portions and slow service, so be ready to sit and enjoy good company and conversation. The wines are pricey, so beware if you don't want to spend $30 on a bottle. On the night we went (Tuesday), the wine was half off, so that was a good surprise. We were served cheesy bread, eggplant, salad, chicken, salmon, mussels, prawn, and pasta, all a little bit at a time. The basket of toasted French bread was refilled twice. All the dishes were delicious, with very good sauces. For dessert the server brought out a large plate with three slices of different pastries plus sherbet, and we all dug in. Our meals with tip came to less than $48 per person. We had enough delicious food to fill us up, and we enjoyed a very pleasant evening out. If you are a picky eater, if you don't like surprises, and if you want huge portions, skip this unusual restaurant and go to Olive Garden or Applebees. Otherwise, come prepared to have fun!

You can dine right next to the marina, and you have a view of the boats, Capitol Building, and the Olympic Mountains. We had the fish and chips and the veggie tacos. The meal was fine, but nothing out of this world. Service was a bit slow, and we think they forgot to offer soup or salad and bread, but we didn't think it came with our dinner until we heard the next table being offered soup/salad/bread. (Our fault though, we didn't say anything.) There was a mix-up on paying with our credit card; another table's bill got charged to our card, but we noticed and it was cleared up quickly.

"We ate there because it was recommended by a local as having been written up in Sunset Magaizine. Alec's restaurant has luxury restaurant prices, with a Denny's atmosphere and food. We were seated in a very small table in the lounge, right by the front door. The restaurant has booths, no tablecloths, etc. - very ""Denny's or Shari's"". Our meal was plentiful, but average. The bread with the meal didn't come in a bread basket, but was placed on top of my pasta, making it soggy and unappetizing. Friendliness and service were marginal. This was my birthday dinner and we paid lots for a disappointing meal.",16-May-11,20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58648-d1171876-r108508617-Alec_s_By_the_Sea-Ocean_Shores_Washington.html
"We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Grand Resort at Seaworld. We stayed in the 2 room suite, which was huge. The pools were extremely nice and clean. The hotel is right across from Seaworld and only 10 - 15 minutes from the Disney parks. The only negative thing about the hotel is that they only bring bath linens once a week, so our family of four quickly ran out of washcloths. However, a call to the front desk was all it took for them to bring some to our room. Overall, we had a nice stay and we would definitely stay there again.",29-Oct-09,50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d223711-r48066629-Hilton_Grand_Vacations_at_SeaWorld-Orlando_Florida.html
