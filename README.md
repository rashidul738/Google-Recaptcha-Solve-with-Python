Google Recaptcha Solve with Python
The audio versions of ReCAPTCHA are way faster. If you’re going to solve these challenges at all, opt for the audio clues first. This means whenever you’re presented with a visual challenge, ignore it straight away and click “Play” on the audio button.

If you can hear the sound properly on your device, it shouldn’t take very long to solve the audio challenge. With Image ReCAPTCHA, I get it wrong almost nine times out of ten. This could be because the audio challenges use simple English words which means a greater probability of getting them right the first time.
